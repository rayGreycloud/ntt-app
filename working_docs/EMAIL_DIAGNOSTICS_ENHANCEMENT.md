# Email Send Diagnostics Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced email service with comprehensive logging and error visibility to diagnose email sending failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Email Service (`src/lib/email-service.ts`)

#### Pre-send Validation & Logging

- ‚úÖ Check for `SENDGRID_API_KEY` configuration
- ‚úÖ Check for `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` configuration (with warning if missing)
- ‚úÖ Log email details before sending:
  - To address
  - From address
  - Subject line

#### Success Logging

- ‚úÖ Log successful send with:
  - HTTP status code
  - SendGrid message ID (from response headers)

#### Enhanced Error Handling

- ‚úÖ Detailed error logging with emoji indicators
- ‚úÖ Specific error messages for common SendGrid status codes:
  - `401` - Invalid API key
  - `403` - Sender not verified
  - `413` - Email too large
  - `429` - Rate limit exceeded
  - `500+` - Service unavailable
- ‚úÖ Log full error response body for debugging
- ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript error handling (no `any` types)

### 2. OTP Service (`src/lib/otp-service.ts`)

#### Enhanced OTP Email Sending

- ‚úÖ Log when attempting to send OTP email in production mode
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error message that includes specific email service error
- ‚úÖ Success confirmation logging

#### Enhanced Error Logging

- ‚úÖ Detailed catch block logging with:
  - Error object
  - Error message (if Error instance)
  - Stack trace (if Error instance)

  Status Code: 403
  Body: { "errors": [...] }
‚ùå Failed to send OTP email: Email sending forbidden (check sender verification)

## Diagnostic Checklist

When debugging email failures, check the console logs for:

1. **Configuration Issues**

   - Is `SENDGRID_API_KEY` configured?
   - Is `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` set?

2. **Authentication Issues**

   - Status code 401 = Invalid API key
   - Check API key is correct in environment variables

3. **Authorization Issues**

   - Status code 403 = Sender not verified
   - Verify sender email in SendGrid dashboard

4. **Rate Limiting**

   - Status code 429 = Too many requests
   - Check SendGrid plan limits

5. **Service Issues**
   - Status code 500+ = SendGrid service problem
   - Check SendGrid status page

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Required for email sending
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxx...
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Optional for testing
MOCK_AUTH=true  # Disables email sending, logs OTP to console
```

## Testing

To test the enhanced diagnostics:

1. **Test with missing API key**:

   - Comment out `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
   - Try to send OTP
   - Should see "Email service not configured" error

2. **Test with invalid API key**:

   - Set `SENDGRID_API_KEY` to an invalid value
   - Try to send OTP
   - Should see "Email authentication failed" error

3. **Test with unverified sender**:

   - Set `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` to an unverified email
   - Try to send OTP
   - Should see "Email sending forbidden" error

4. **Test successful send**:
   - Configure valid SendGrid credentials
   - Try to send OTP
   - Should see success logs with message ID

## Next Steps

If email sending still fails after these enhancements:

1. Check the detailed console logs for specific error codes
2. Verify SendGrid configuration in their dashboard
3. Check SendGrid activity feed for failed attempts
4. Ensure sender email is verified in SendGrid
5. Check SendGrid API key permissions
