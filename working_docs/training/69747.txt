          22          with the District on the water issues,

          23          which I'll get into in just a moment, and

          24          also filing the -- the cross motion had to

          25          do with Plaintiff's claim for damages

                                                                   9




           1          against PV Ranch for harm done to their

           2          cattle herd for the alleged -- you know,

           3          allegedly caused by the staging of water at

           4          the double culverts.

           5                So the Court granted the District's

           6          motion.  The Court granted PV Ranch's Cross

           7          Motion.  Plaintiff's filed Motions for

           8          Reconsideration on both.  The Court denied

           9          both.  And, you know, some of the things

          10          that were argued at the Motion for Summary

          11          Judgement hearing and also argued in their

          12          Motion for Reconsideration, which the Court

          13          denied without a hearing, was, you know,

          14          what water was the Plaintiff, Pearce Ranch,

          15          allowed to use with their permit that was

          16          issued to them by the District in 2016 --

          17          and that's Permit Number 22-00127W.

          18                And the Court concluded in its order

          19          granting Motion for Summary Judgement, that

          20          the water source for that particular permit

          21          was Paradise Run.  There's a pump.

          22          Paradise Run is up to the north end of the

          23          property owned by D.L. Pearce Ranch.

          24                THE COURT:  The old Kissimmee River

          25          basically.

                                                                   10




           1                MR. JORGENSEN:  Right.  Correct.

           2          Paradise Run is -- as it is called now.

           3          And that was the source of the water.

           4                Plaintiff argued out the hearing and

           5          argued a motion for reconsideration that

           6          the Court should consider this stub canal

           7          as they call it or a breach as the District

           8          calls it in the L-59 cattle canal, which is

           9          way south at the south -- way south of

          10          where the pump and the source of water is

          11          under the permit.  And the Court denied

          12          that in that Motion for Reconsideration and

          13          also took that into account, I believe,

          14          when the Court issued its order denying

          15          Motion for Summary Judgement -- or granting

          16          the Motion for Summary Judgement and the

          17          Cross Motion for Summary Judgement.

          18                So, you know, there's been a flurry

          19          of --

          20                THE COURT:  However, I clarified --

          21                MR. JORGENSEN:  You did.

          22                THE COURT:  -- in that order that

          23          any property that -- or any water that

          24          exited the boundaries of the L-59 canal and

          25          breached onto the property of the Plaintiff

                                                                   11




           1          was usable until such time as that breach

           2          in the canal is repaired, if that's South

           3          Florida Water Management's intention.

           4                MR. JORGENSEN:  Correct.  And then I

           5          guess the issue then -- and I don't know if

           6          the Court has considered this or not as

           7          okay -- there is a breach or there is a

           8          stub canal, is that stub canal included in

           9          the Permit 00127W.

          10                THE COURT:  Once the water leaves

          11          outside the L-59 canal and goes onto their

          12          property, that's permitted.

          13                MR. JORGENSEN:  Permitted under that

          14          particular permit or not?

          15                THE COURT:  Once -- Counsel, let's

          16          say, for example, that we had a huge

          17          rainstorm where water flowed over the banks

          18          of the L-59 canal and went onto the

          19          Plaintiff's property.  He can use it.  It's

          20          not part of the L-59 waterway anymore.

          21                And so what I've held is there's a

          22          breach in that canal that is flowing onto

          23          his property outside the boundaries of the

          24          L-59 canal; and, therefore, it's not

          25          subject to a permit at that point.  So if

                                                                   12




           1          South Florida Water Management wants to

           2          stop him from using that, they'll have to

           3          go repair it.

           4                MR. JORGENSEN:  So then the question

           5          before the Court or at least the question

           6          that I would have for the Court is, all

           7          right, does that clarification or ruling

           8          that the Court made in its -- in the order

           9          on the Motion for Reconsideration, does

          10          that affect the Court's Summary Judgement

          11          rulings previously.

          12                THE COURT:  It does not affect the

          13          Summary Judgements as it relates to drawing

          14          water directly from the L-59 canal.  He

          15          does not have a permit to draw water from

          16          the L-59 canal.  That water loses it's

          17          characteristic as water from the L-59 canal

          18          once it flows onto his property because

          19          there's a breach.

          20                I mean, for example, if he was to

          21          take that water and pump it back, would

          22          that be a violation of Florida law?  I

          23          don't think so.  So once it leaves the

          24          canal property, the boundaries of the

          25          canal, and goes onto his property, then it

                                                                   13




           1          loses its characteristic as water from the

           2          L-59 canal.  That can be easily prevented

           3          if they go repair the breach.  And then all

           4          of a sudden then it's all water that

           5          belongs to the L-59 canal.  He does have a

           6          permit to use it.

           7                MR. JORGENSEN:  All right.  So part

           8          of the scope of the Court's orders was that

           9          the Plaintiff, D.L. Pearce Ranch, doesn't

          10          have any remaining common law right under

          11          the 1962 --

          12                THE COURT:  The have no common law

          13          rights because of the Florida State

          14          Statutes that were passed in 1972 taking

          15          common law water rights off the books,

          16          making it statutory and setting up the

          17          Water Control District.  Coupled with, of

          18          course, I guess there was a two-year window

          19          by which folks who had permits were they

          20          were drawing could apply for permits.  I

          21          don't see any indication that that was done

          22          in this particular case by the Plaintiff or

          23          the owner of the Plaintiff's property.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  And then the other

          25          question I think is -- again, the Court

                                                                   14




           1          granted PV Ranch its Cross Motion for

           2          Summary Judgement finding no -- that the

           3          Plaintiff didn't have a claim for damage to

           4          his cattle herd.  Does the Court's --

           5          clarification.

           6                THE COURT:  Well, I did have a claim

           7          for damage for his cattle herd as a result

           8          of blocking the L-59 canal.  He doesn't

           9          have a right to pull water from the L-59

          10          canal.

          11                MR. JORGENSEN:  Correct.

          12                THE COURT:  So if he's alleging the

          13          damage was caused because he was -- because

          14          the water was blocked and there was no

          15          water downstream that he could us the pump

          16          from, that's not relevant because he didn't

          17          have a right to pump that water.

          18                MR. JORGENSEN:  Okay.  All right.

          19                So I think -- I mean, for my

          20          purposes or for my client's purposes, that

          21          clarifies, you know, what the issues are

          22          before the Court today.  And I don't know

          23          if the Plaintiff --

          24                THE COURT:  It's real simple.  If

          25          they don't want him using any of the water

                                                                   15




           1          that even comes from the L-59 canal, patch

           2          the breach and then all the water stays

           3          where it's supposed to stay which is in the

           4          L-59 canal.  And then there really isn't

           5          anything to talk about as far as I'm

           6          concerned.

           7                With regard to water usage of the

           8          L-59 canal, there is no permit the

           9          Plaintiffs have to use water from the L-59

          10          canal.  Once it leaves the L-59 canal, it

          11          loses its characteristic as water -- L-59

          12          canal water.

          13                MR. JORGENSEN:  Correct.  And

          14          concerning PV Ranch's, you know, staging

          15          water at the L-59 canal, as far as I can

          16          tell by the Court's ruling that's not

          17          affected by your clarification?

          18                THE COURT:  That is not affected.

          19          It would be relevant if downstream property

          20          owners had a right to pump from the L-59

          21          canal.  But since I haven't been shown that

          22          there's anyone downstream who is a party to

          23          this case who's affected by it, then they

          24          can continue to stage the water.

          25                And that's -- if you don't have --

                                                                   16




           1          if you don't have the right to take water

           2          from the L-59 canal, you don't really have

           3          a right to gripe that somebody's staging it

           4          where you wouldn't have water even if you

           5          were allowed to have water.  Does that make

           6          sense?

           7                MR. JORGENSEN:  I completely

           8          understand that.

           9                So if my Motion in Limine was to

          10          exclude a lot of these issues involving

          11          what the 1962 stipulation and whether

          12          they -- whether the Plaintiff has a right

          13          to use water out of the L-59.  And those

          14          are the issues that I did not want evidence

          15          to be introduced --

          16                THE COURT:  Well, and I understand

          17          that and I know it has taken us a long time

          18          to get to this point.  There was a lot of

          19          research and homework that had to be done

          20          to get to that point.

          21                Now, if we were just here on the

          22          agreement from '61, there it all comes in;

          23          but we're not.  The State of Florida

          24          intervened in 1972, changed all the rules,

          25          eliminated common law water rights --

                                                                   17




           1          either pro or con depending upon your

           2          position -- and required that property --

           3          or that water drawn from the property

           4          controlled by South Florida Water

           5          Management had to have a permit.  And they

           6          left the door open for a period of -- and

           7          actually the door is still open.  I mean,

           8          you could still apply for permits to pump

           9          water from any canal.  I mean, they're

          10          not -- Plaintiffs are not foreclosed.

          11                And then we -- then we get into the

          12          issue of, okay, now staging might be a

          13          problem; now South Florida Water Management

          14          might have to come in and put some rules

          15          and regulations in place.  But that's a

          16          future issue that we're not here for.

          17                MR. JORGENSEN:  So based on the

          18          Court's rulings and based on the comments

          19          of the -- of his Honor that you've just

          20          made, I think the remaining issues are

          21          regard the central easement -- completion

          22          of the central easement down to Highway 78,

          23          which was PV Ranch's third-party complaint.

          24          And the --

          25                THE COURT:  I'm not even sure that

                                                                   18




           1          was -- that should be an issue.  I thought

           2          that was resolved in 1995 by Judge Reese.

           3                MR. JORGENSEN:  Yeah.  Well, that

           4          was 28 years ago.  And --

           5                THE COURT:  I don't care.

           6                MR. JORGENSEN:  On the ground, it's

           7          not quite resolved.

           8                THE COURT:  Until somebody withdraws

           9          that order, it's still in full force and

          10          effect.  And if necessary, you know,

          11          Judge Reese shows up here once a month as a

          12          senior judge.  I can have him come back in

          13          and reiterate it if we need to.

          14                MR. JORGENSEN:  I'd be happy with

          15          that.

          16                And then the other issue is who has

          17          a right to use the alternate easement and

          18          where does it go.

          19                THE COURT:  Yup.

          20                MR. JORGENSEN:  Those are the issues

          21          that I think; the Plaintiff may differ.

          22          But that's my --

          23                THE COURT:  I'm sure they do.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  Thank you, Judge.

          25                THE COURT:  You don't have anything

                                                                   19




           1          to add to that, do you?

           2                MR. GLASS:  No, your Honor.  I think

           3          based on what you've said -- I mean, we

           4          came into this not knowing exactly what

           5          issues were left for the District and it

           6          sounds like there are none.  So thank you.

           7                THE COURT:  Yeah.  Well, I have my

           8          personal opinion on that but not a legal

           9          opinion.

          10                Do ahead.

          11                MR. ESPY:  Hi, your Honor.  I'm

          12          Alan Espy.  I'm kind of new to the case.

          13          We would --

          14                THE COURT:  Welcome.

          15                MR. ESPY:  Thank you.

          16                So our contention is that the scope

          17          of the Court's Summary Judgement ruling

          18          would not preclude the Plaintiff from

          19          putting their case-in-chief on -- they

          20          think it's PV Ranch and the other two

          21          defendants.  And the distinctions we would

          22          draw with some of the comments the Court

          23          just made is that the water that goes into

          24          this stub canal -- it's not a breach.  This

          25          canal -- this stub canal has been there

                                                                   20




           1          since before the L-59 borrow canal was put

           2          it.  And at the time of the '62 agreement,

           3          it was there.

           4                And the '62 agreement, which I know

           5          the Court has seen --

           6                THE COURT:  Up until this point --

           7          this is the first I've heard of this.  Up

           8          until this point, I've been told it was a

           9          breach in the canal wall.

          10                MR. ESPY:  No, sir.

          11                THE COURT:  That's the term that's

          12          been thrown around for every hearing we've

          13          had on it so far.

          14                MR. JORGENSEN:  No.

          15                MR. ESPY:  I think that was a

          16          misrepresentation.  It's been there --

          17          we're going to present evidence that it's

          18          been there since long before the L-59 canal

          19          was constructed and that it's been a source

          20          of irrigation water for Sections 9 and 16

          21          currently owned by the Plaintiff all during

          22          that time going back to the 60s.

          23                So that we don't -- I mean, we do,

          24          as you know and of the motions we filed,

          25          contend that our permit allowed us to draw

                                                                   21




           1          water from this canal.  But the Court's

           2          already ruled we don't need a permit to

           3          draw water from the stub canal.  And it's

           4          been there since the 50s.  And the '62

           5          agreement provided that the purpose of the

           6          headers of the double culverts was to give

           7          better water control to the parties

           8          Defendant and all other owners served by

           9          Levee 59 and its borrow canal.

          10                My clients are east of the -- well,

          11          my client and its property and the stub

          12          canal is east of the double culverts.

          13                THE COURT:  East and north.

          14                MR. ESPY:  East and north; yes, sir.

          15                And it has been benefitted by that

          16          water in the stub canal for many, many

          17          years.  Our case is that the -- in the

          18          early part of 2016, the Defendants placed

          19          these boards in the headers in a deliberate

          20          attempt to deprive the Plaintiff of water.

          21          And despite repeated requests made by

          22          Mr. Pearce in the winter of 2016 when it

          23          was exceptionally dry to the point of being

          24          in a drought, he made a dozen or more

          25          requests to have the boards removed so that

                                                                   22




           1          water would flow into the stub canal and he

           2          could use that to irrigate his pastures.

           3                They refused to do that and that

           4          caused him significant damage.  And, you

           5          know, the term breach, I think, has been a

           6          misnomer because this isn't a breach.  This

           7          isn't --

           8                THE COURT:  Well, that's the term

           9          that has been consistently presented to

          10          this court.  That it was a breach in the

          11          canal.

          12                MR. ESPY:  I don't think it's been

          13          present by the Plaintiff.

          14                THE COURT:  No, it has not.

          15                MR. ESPY:  And so Mr. Pearce is

          16          prepared to testify about this stub canal,

          17          how long it's been there, how it's been

          18          used.  And I think, respectfully, the

          19          evidence will show this is not some breach

          20          that occurred as a result of a lack of

          21          repair to the canal.  It's been there the

          22          whole time.  It's been used the whole time.

          23                The parties were all aware of it and

          24          Mr. Pearce has use of it.  And that,

          25          therefore, the Plaintiff should be allowed

                                                                   23




           1          to go forward with their case-in-chief.

           2                MR. JORGENSEN:  If I may,

           3          your Honor, briefly?

           4                THE COURT:  Briefly.

           5                MR. JORGENSEN:  All right.  Well,

           6          these are all things that could have been

           7          brought up in response or in opposition to

           8          the District's Motion for Summary Judgement

           9          that was filed on June 12th.

          10                THE COURT:  Yeah.  But, Counsel, my

          11          ruling -- the second after the Motion for

          12          Clarification, or for rehearing rather, and

          13          I clarified that.  And it's obvious from

          14          the tenor of that and content of that order

          15          that this was represented to the Court as

          16          water that had, for lack of a better term,

          17          escaped from the L-59 canal and if it

          18          flowed onto the property of the Plaintiff;

          19          not that this was some long-term

          20          long-standing -- the term that keeps being

          21          used is stub canal.

          22                But that's -- I find that to be

          23          disturbing because the term "breach" to me

          24          mean some accidental flow of water because

          25          the canal was not properly maintained and

                                                                   24




           1          this water had escaped from its normal

           2          course and path on the L-59 canal.  And now

           3          I'm hearing for the first time ever since I

           4          got involved in this case in 2017 that that

           5          stub canal has existed that entire time.

           6                MR. JORGENSEN:  And I can say I

           7          didn't know about it either.  But what I

           8          recall -- and I'll look at the Motion for

           9          Summary Judgement didn't mention it, their

          10          response didn't mention it -- it came up at

          11          the hearing on the Motion for Summary

          12          Judgement.  And Mr. Brewer called it a stub

          13          canal and the District called it a breach.

          14                So my point --

          15                THE COURT:  Well, there's a distinct

          16          definitional difference to me --

          17                MR. JORGENSEN:  There is.

          18                THE COURT:  -- between a stub canal

          19          and a breach.  A stub canal is something

          20          which is intentional; a breach of something

          21          which is not.

          22                MR. JORGENSEN:  I don't have a

          23          quarrel whether it's a stub canal or a

          24          breach as long as --

          25                THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to

                                                                   25




           1          let the -- on this information.  I'm going

           2          to let them present their case.  I think

           3          this changes the entire tenor -- based on

           4          my ruling where I said they could pull

           5          water that's not in the L-59 canal, it

           6          loses its characterization.  Which is

           7          what -- is what I indicated in my order

           8          that it loses its characterization as water

           9          from the L-59 canal because of a lack of

          10          maintenance and that's not the case at all.

          11          And I feel that I've been misled quite

          12          frankly.

          13                MR. JORGENSEN:  I don't know what

          14          the case is and I certainly didn't

          15          misrepresent the Court because the stub

          16          canal didn't come up until the hearing on

          17          the Motion for Summary Judgement.  But,

          18          again, I just need to understand the scope

          19          of the Court's allowing them to present --

          20                THE COURT:  Well, Counsel, I'm

          21          now -- you know, this is not -- this is not

          22          water that's being pumped.  I still

          23          maintain that he cannot pump water from the

          24          boundaries of the L-59 canal.  But if this

          25          water is flowing out of the canal and onto

                                                                   26




           1          his property which is not part of the

           2          property owned by South Florida Water

           3          Management or with an easement put in and

           4          is actually something that runs onto his

           5          property, that water is his to be used.

           6                MR. JORGENSEN:  Understood.

           7                And just so I understand the Court's

           8          clarification, does this affect the Court's

           9          order finding that my client can stage

          10          water without any liability as to any

          11          damages to the cattle herd or whatever

          12          else -- and what was argued by the

          13          Plaintiff originally in this case?

          14                THE COURT:  Based upon what is

          15          evidence is -- we're just going to present

          16          the case now.

          17                MR. JORGENSEN:  Okay.

          18                THE COURT:  I will -- I will make

          19          that ruling depending upon what the

          20          testimony shows in this case.  And, like I

          21          said, up until this point, I felt that the

          22          issues were going to be limited.  Now I'm

          23          understanding that this is a canal which

          24          has existed since prior to 1972 and it does

          25          not -- and I have not heard the testimony

                                                                   27




           1          yet.  It may or may not part of the

           2          property owned as part of the L-59 canal.

           3          I don't know.  I don't know that.  I'm

           4          suspecting now that maybe it isn't.

           5                MR. JORGENSEN:  I have to say one

           6          more thing, your Honor, just for the

           7          record.  I mean, this came up, again, at

           8          the Summary Judgement hearing.  The

           9          pretrial stipulation I think was filed

          10          September 12th.  It's prejudicial to

          11          PV Ranch.  I would say it's also

          12          prejudicial to --

          13                THE COURT:  Sir, what's prejudicial

          14          is the fact that this was not properly

          15          present to Court.  This -- it was

          16          represented at that hearing that this was

          17          water that had escaped from the L-59 canal

          18          because of a breach.  Which to this Court,

          19          and I think to most folks out there on the

          20          street, breach means that it escaped and it

          21          wasn't supposed to, that something wasn't

          22          being maintained.  Had this Court been

          23          fully informed of that at the time, my

          24          decision very well may have been different.

          25                So it was based upon the

                                                                   28




           1          representation -- I won't go as so far to

           2          say misrepresentation -- but the

           3          representation and its logical conclusions

           4          that could be drawn from that.  Which I

           5          find particularly disturbing at this point.

           6                MR. JORGENSEN:  Understood, your

           7          Honor.

           8                But, again, the only other issue

           9          I'll bring up is they're going to present

          10          evidence about the stub canal -- historical

          11          evidence.  We haven't had any opportunity

          12          for discovery or to do anything like that

          13          because this was a brand new --

          14                THE COURT:  Counsel, that's your

          15          fault.  That canal has been there

          16          apparently now, according to the

          17          representation -- I've not heard the

          18          evidence yet, but according to

          19          representation, that canal has been there

          20          for a long time.  This is not a surprise to

          21          anyone who was involved in this particular

          22          case that that canal has been there and it

          23          is -- may or may not be depending upon the

          24          evidence outside of the boundaries of the

          25          L-59 canal.

                                                                   29




           1                Now, whether or not that impacts the

           2          staging of that depends upon whether or not

           3          this Court believes that there was an

           4          acquiescence for use of that water by

           5          either South Florida Water Management by

           6          not doing anything to either require a

           7          permit or to block off that stub canal.

           8          These are all issues now that -- that I

           9          don't have the answers for.

          10                But I go back to what I originally

          11          said and that is this was represented to

          12          the Court during the course of this as a

          13          breach.  To me, I thought it was -- and

          14          maybe I should have asked more questions,

          15          but it should have been presented.  To me,

          16          this looks like something that had recently

          17          occurred.  But now I'm hearing maybe that's

          18          not -- maybe that's not the case.

          19                MR. JORGENSEN:  Understood, your

          20          Honor.

          21                THE COURT:  All right.  Have a seat,

          22          sir.  We're going to get started with the

          23          trial.

          24                MR. GLASS:  Your Honor, may I

          25          address the Court very briefly?

                                                                   30




           1                THE COURT:  Very briefly.

           2                MR. GLASS:  The District -- in terms

           3          of the regulation of water in this stub

           4          canal, I -- you know, the District was --

           5          is willing to abide by the Court's order

           6          and clarification; but the District's

           7          position is by statute that all of that

           8          water is still subject to regulation by the

           9          District even if it flows into that stub

          10          canal, even if that stub canal has been

          11          there for 60 years.  I have some briefing

          12          on that if I can hand it up.

          13                THE COURT:  You can.

          14                MR. GLASS:  Such that, you know,

          15          all -- because all water in Florida is

          16          subject to regulation, any use of that

          17          water requires a water-use permit.  Even if

          18          this water has gone into this stub canal,

          19          it would still require a permit from the

          20          District to use.

          21                THE COURT:  So if I read your

          22          interpretation correctly, if I decide, for

          23          example, I'm going to -- on my property

          24          within its boundaries I'm going to dig some

          25          water out and there's a pond there, you

                                                                   31




           1          control it?

           2                MR. GLASS:  Not if it's for domestic

           3          use.  But if it's for commercial use, it

           4          technically would require a permit, yes,

           5          according to --

           6                THE COURT:  And I have cows and my

           7          cows are going to come in there and they're

           8          going use the pond that I dug, you control

           9          it?

          10                MR. GLASS:  We don't control it.

          11          But if it's -- if there's a commercial use,

          12          then it technically would require a water

          13          use permit according to the statutory --

          14                THE COURT:  According to your

          15          interpretations.

          16                MR. GLASS:  According to the

          17          agency's interpretation.

          18                THE COURT:  Okay.  I think your

          19          interpretation is a little broad.

          20                Well, that will be your position.

          21          You can argue it.  Let's get started with

          22          the trial.

          23                MR. ESPY:  Your Honor?

          24                THE COURT:  Yes.

          25                MR. ESPY:  Pardon me for

                                                                   32




           1          interrupting the Court.  But before we get

           2          started with the trial, there are no claims

           3          to my knowledge currently pending against

           4          the District.  And we would object to them

           5          participating in the -- we didn't sue the

           6          District.

           7                THE COURT:  They tried to get out

           8          before.  I wouldn't let them so they're in.

           9                MR. ESPY:  Then I think that the

          10          claims between the District and the

          11          Defendants have all been resolved either by

          12          agreement or summary judgement.  I don't

          13          know if there any claims remaining pending

          14          before the Court.  And, obviously, I'll --

          15          if I'm mistaken, I'm glad to be corrected.

          16          But I believe that to be the case.  And we

          17          don't want -- therefore, we would object to

          18          them participating in the trial.

          19                MR. JORGENSEN:  Well, since the

          20          Court is reopened this issue of water use,

          21          that was one of the issues in the dec

          22          action that was brought in the --

          23                THE COURT:  Yeah, they're there.

          24                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  Then we're ready.

          25                THE COURT:  Opening statement.

                                                                   33




           1                MR. ESPY:  Thank you, your Honor.

           2                I know the Court is well aware of

           3          the issues here, as we've rehashed a lot of

           4          them this morning.

           5                THE COURT:  Painfully so.

           6                MR. ESPY:  But I'll briefly

           7          summarize the Plaintiff's case.  Sometime

           8          during the first part of 2016, the

           9          Defendants -- who are Jeanette Peeples,

          10          Jeanette Peeples as trustee, and

          11          PV Ranch -- directed that boards be placed

          12          into the risers of the double culverts,

          13          which stopped water from flowing downstream

          14          to the east in the L-59 canal.

          15                The Plaintiff, D.L. Pearce Ranch,

          16          owns real property that are downstream from

          17          the double culverts.  And the L-59 flows

          18          into -- water flows into this stub canal

          19          that -- on the Plaintiff's property.  And

          20          that stub canal has been there since prior

          21          to the construction of the L-59 borrow

          22          canal and to our knowledge at least since

          23          1957.  And Mr. Pearce is prepared to

          24          testify to that and we have another witness

          25          who is prepared to testify to testify to

                                                                   34




           1          that.  And that water has been utilized by

           2          my clients -- that water in the stub

           3          canal -- for irrigation purposes since that

           4          time.

           5                There's an odd sort of history of

           6          permits with respect to the operation of

           7          the risers at the double culverts in the

           8          pertinent time frame that began with

           9          Jeanette Peeples having the permit, then

          10          went to Jeanette Peeples and

          11          John Austin Collier and his wife, and Byron

          12          Storey.  And then it went to PV Ranch,

          13          which is a LLC, I believe, that is managed

          14          by Jeanette Peeples in 2016.  So it's --

          15          these changes were occurring roughly in the

          16          time frame when these boards were placed in

          17          the risers.

          18                Billy Carlton -- William Carlton --

          19          is Ms. Peeples' son and he is the manager

          20          for Ms. Peeples who owns the property on

          21          both sides of the double culverts.  And

          22          Mr. Carlton has also taken it upon himself

          23          to manage the headers, if you will, at the

          24          double culverts that are permitted.

          25          Sometime in early to mid 2016, Mr. Carlton

                                                                   35




           1          at his mother's direction -- his is the son

           2          of Ms. Peeples -- placed boards in the

           3          risers which has significantly disrupted

           4          the flow of water through the double

           5          culverts to the east.

           6                This did not become a problem for

           7          the Plaintiff until the winter of 2016

           8          which was a particularly dry -- dry season.

           9          So dry that Mark Hunter Pearce has referred

          10          to it in his testimony as a drought.  Under

          11          these circumstances, the Plaintiff which

          12          maintained approximately 600 head of cattle

          13          north of the L-59 -- on his property north

          14          of the L-59 canal needed the water from the

          15          stub canal to irrigate this property that

          16          he owned north of the borrow canal.

          17                On at least a dozen occasions,

          18          according to Mr. Mark Hunter Pearce, he

          19          made requests to the Defendants

          20          specifically through Mr. Carlton to remove

          21          these boards during this drought so that he

          22          could get water into the stub canal and use

          23          it to irrigate his pastures and he

          24          explained multiple times why he needed it,

          25          that his grass wasn't growing, that his

                                                                   36




           1          cows were going hungry, and that it was

           2          going to cost him a lot of money if they

           3          didn't allow this water to flow.  And his

           4          request were steadfastly and wrongfully

           5          refused.

           6                As a consequence, the Plaintiff

           7          could not obtain sufficient water to

           8          irrigate his pasture lands north of the

           9          L-59 canal in Sections 16 and 9.  And as a

          10          result of this lack of water -- it was a

          11          lack of grass which resulted in significant

          12          damages to the Plaintiff, which Mr. Pearce

          13          is prepared to testify about.  Those

          14          occurring in the winter of 2016 into the

          15          spring of 2017.  Mr. Pearce had to sell

          16          cows he would not otherwise have sold.

          17          Many of the mama cows were dry in 2017 and

          18          did not go back to normal birthing for

          19          several years because the malnutrition.

          20                What grass there was very short,

          21          which caused worm issues that required the

          22          cows to be dewormed more frequently and

          23          other medical expenses.  Alternative feeds

          24          had to brought in which is quite expensive.

          25          The malnourished cows lost weight.  And

                                                                   37




           1          those that were sold had a lesser market

           2          value because of that.

           3                Mr. Pearce has estimated his losses

           4          as a result of this episode in 2016 and

           5          2017 at approximately $800,000.  And all of

           6          this would have been prevented had any of

           7          his requests to remove these boards, which

           8          was a fairly simple request -- and, by the

           9          way, those boards have been taken in and

          10          out for years prior to 2016 and 2017

          11          without any incident or disagreement among

          12          the family members.  And Mr. Pearce will

          13          testify about the history of this and when

          14          and why they use it.  It was needed all

          15          during the year but mostly during the dry

          16          season when they use the water from the

          17          stub canal to irrigate the pastures.

          18                The Defendants deny all liability.

          19          But a review of the permit documents and

          20          records in this case show that Mr. Pearce

          21          had every right to request these boards

          22          removed in 2016.

          23                Mark Hunter Pearce has been a

          24          cattleman all of his working life.  In

          25          fact, he's raised cattle on the property

                                                                   38




           1          that we're talking about all of his working

           2          life.  And the issue regarding the boards

           3          in the double culverts go back to an

           4          agreement that was entered into in February

           5          of 1962 in Common Law Case 593 in Glades

           6          County.  That agreement I believe is part

           7          of the court record.  We're certainly

           8          prepared to introduce it into evidence

           9          during the trial.

          10                This agreement was between the

          11          Central and Southern Florida Flood Control

          12          District as petitioner and Austin Pearce,

          13          Rosa Lee Pearce, John F. Pearce, and D.L.

          14          Pearce, who was Mark Hunter's father,

          15          individually and doing business as L Cross

          16          Ranch.  In Paragraph Three of this

          17          agreement, the Flood Control District --

          18          the predecessor of the South Florida Water

          19          Management District -- agreed to construct

          20          at its cost a culvert consistent of two

          21          60-inch culverts a hundred feet west of the

          22          north/south fence of Section 17.  On

          23          Paragraph Three of Page Two of the

          24          agreement, Flood Control gave all of the

          25          Defendants, their grantees, lessees, and

                                                                   39




           1          licensees permits to cross or have right of

           2          way of the culvert.

           3                Also, and more importantly, the

           4          agreement on Page Two states that the

           5          bridge and culvert crossing called for

           6          under the agreement shall become the

           7          property of the Defendants and be

           8          maintained by them.  Paragraph Four of the

           9          agreement, particularly critical in this

          10          case, provides that Flood Control agreed to

          11          grant the Defendants a permit for

          12          installation of the headers and the two

          13          culverts constituting the culvert crossing.

          14          The agreement then goes on to state that

          15          the purpose of the headers was to give

          16          better water control to the party's

          17          defendant and the owner served by the

          18          Levee 59 and its borrow canal.

          19                The Court -- as I believe the Court

          20          is aware, D.L. Pearce who is a defendant in

          21          that agreement and the L Cross Ranch was a

          22          predecessor to my client D.L. Pearce Ranch,

          23          Inc.  And it is our contention that -- in

          24          fact, hasn't really been -- if you look at

          25          the history of the documents in this case

                                                                   40




           1          including the documents with the District,

           2          people constantly refer to this '62

           3          agreement in terms of the rights of the

           4          current owners of this property.  And it's

           5          contention that our client has entitlement

           6          to enforce the terms of this '62 agreement.

           7                The provision that I just referred

           8          to in Paragraph Four of the agreement, that

           9          which states the purpose of the headers is

          10          to get better water control to the

          11          defendants and others served by the borrow

          12          canal, is essentially a covenant that runs

          13          with the land.  This provision has relation

          14          to the land that is the subject of this

          15          agreement.  And the things to be done, that

          16          is the use of the headers and the boards,

          17          touches the land involved and the

          18          occupation use and enjoyment thereof.  When

          19          a covenant runs with the land, successors

          20          to the property owner who made that

          21          covenant become liable as promisees under

          22          the promise made by the predecessors.  And

          23          there's never been any motion to my

          24          knowledge raised before the Court that

          25          we're not entitled to enforce that '62

                                                                   41




           1          agreement.  And this obligation was not

           2          aggregated by the passing of Florida Water

           3          Resources Act of 1972.

           4                Again, we're not contending that we

           5          had a permit to draw water directly from

           6          the L-59 borrow canal.  Our contention is

           7          that we certainly had the right and had for

           8          40 years -- or 50 years at the time this

           9          occurred -- draw water from the stub canal.

          10          And the Court heard our considered our

          11          Motion for Reconsideration.  The permit we

          12          did have is somewhat inconsistent and

          13          ambiguous as to where we were entitled to

          14          pump water from, but we will present

          15          testimony that the description of where

          16          that permit that Mr. Pearce did have -- the

          17          property it applied to was where the --

          18          where the stub canal is.

          19                So the -- as I mentioned to the

          20          Court earlier in my argument -- I'm trying

          21          to avoid repeating things I've already

          22          said -- but the evidence we will present

          23          will show that this stub canal was there

          24          long before the L-59.  And it had been in

          25          constant use between the construction of

                                                                   42




           1          the L-59 borrow canal and the '72

           2          statutory -- in fact, it had been used

           3          without dispute between the parties right

           4          up until really the time that this current

           5          dispute occurred.

           6                This isn't a case of disrepair of

           7          the L-59 borrow canal.  This is a situation

           8          where this stub canal had been there for

           9          many, many years; relied upon by my

          10          clients.  The Defendants were aware of it.

          11          They were aware that my clients used it.

          12          And they had an obligation under the '62

          13          agreement to act reasonably and not

          14          maliciously in denying him water.

          15                So for these reasons, we'll present

          16          evidence showing that my clients are

          17          entitled to recover against the Defendants

          18          for the damages we're seeking in this

          19          matter.  Thank you, your Honor.

          20                THE COURT:  Okay.

          21                MR. BREWER:  And, your Honor, I

          22          don't want to add anything to what was said

          23          but we've got another issue that is -- does

          24          not involve the District at all.  And

          25          that's the easements.

                                                                   43




           1                THE COURT:  The easement.

           2                MR. BREWER:  And so I would suggest

           3          to the Court that it would be better to

           4          split those two issues and not try to try

           5          them at the same time because it's

           6          confusing enough, quite frankly, with just

           7          the issues about the water.  And so --

           8                THE COURT:  I don't think I'll

           9          necessarily get confused.  They're totally

          10          two separate issues.  And, yes, I will

          11          agree the second issue, the issue of the

          12          easement, does not involve South Florida

          13          Water Management.

          14                MR. BREWER:  So for their

          15          convenience, once we get through the water,

          16          if --

          17                (Simultaneously speaking.)

          18                THE COURT:  I don't care.  If you

          19          folks want to bifurcate that and leave off

          20          the issue of the easement for now and bring

          21          it up later, that's fine with me.

          22                MR. ESPY:  I didn't address the

          23          easements, your Honor, since we didn't sue

          24          on it.  Mr. Brewer is going to handle the

          25          easement issue.

                                                                   44




           1                THE COURT:  All right.  PV Ranch.

           2                MR. JORGENSEN:  I don't want to

           3          bifurcate, your Honor.  I'd rather just get

           4          this over with.

           5                THE COURT:  I don't care.  We don't

           6          have to bifurcate it.  I'll sit here and

           7          listen to the whole thing.

           8                MR. JORGENSEN:  And the other

           9          issue --

          10                THE COURT:  I'll keep the issues

          11          separate.

          12                MR. JORGENSEN:  As far as the

          13          District is concerned on whether they have

          14          any involvement in the central easement,

          15          they do to a certain extent because the

          16          alternate easement was granted to

          17          Jeanette Peeples or Juanetta -- Juanita --

          18          Juanelle, I got it finally -- Juanelle

          19          Peeples, John Collier, Kim Collier and --

          20          because the Colliers used to own property

          21          north up where the alternative easement

          22          went.

          23                That property is now owned by the

          24          District.  So the District may have some

          25          issue involving how the alternate easement

                                                                   45




           1          is used.

           2                THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead

           3          with your opening.

           4                MR. JORGENSEN:  All right.  Thank

           5          you.  Bear with me.  It's a different

           6          opening than I anticipated.  So I'll try --

           7                THE COURT:  Yeah.

           8                MR. JORGENSEN:  -- to get through

           9          this.

          10                So the history -- I mean, the

          11          history of the double culverts, it was part

          12          of the combination action.  And then as a

          13          result of the taking of the property, they

          14          needed to dig this borrow canal for

          15          purposes of allowing, you know, a source of

          16          water that was cut off by the dyke that was

          17          built.  And that's why it was done.

          18                The water comes from, I think, the

          19          C-40, if I got it right.  There's a permit

          20          issued west which turns water into the L-59

          21          canal, which is the 1695 permit.  And the

          22          application for that permit talks about the

          23          areas of land that are going to be served

          24          by that permit.  And not including in those

          25          lands are the properties owned by --

                                                                   46




           1                THE COURT:  Right.  It specifically

           2          names the sections.

           3                MR. JORGENSEN:  It does.  And it

           4          doesn't name 9 and 16, which are the lands

           5          in question that the Plaintiff is claiming

           6          that its cattle herd was damaged as a

           7          result of lack of water.  So if you look at

           8          the 1695 application and the permit issued,

           9          specifically that water that was turned

          10          into the L-59 canal was meant for sections

          11          upstream.  It wasn't meant for sections

          12          downstream from the double culverts.

          13                So, next, the original permit, I

          14          think was 2128 for the double culverts.

          15          And it was -- those double culverts have

          16          been rebuilt at least two or three times.

          17          And when they were in need of repair and

          18          needed to be replaced, there was corrosion

          19          in the culverts and water would escape

          20          through.  And then the culverts would be

          21          rebuilt and the boards or the risers as

          22          they're called would effectively stage the

          23          water.

          24                When PV Ranch -- PV Ranch was

          25          required by the District to replace the

                                                                   47




           1          culverts, I think in 2015, 2016, it did so

           2          at PV Ranch's expense.  They put in the

           3          culverts.  They hired an engineer,

           4          Tommy Perry, to assist.  I believe the

           5          elevation of the bottom of the culverts was

           6          14 feet and the risers allowed for a

           7          staging of water to 18.5.  And 18.5 is

           8          necessary in order for the upstream

           9          consumptive use permit orders to use water

          10          in the canal and that would include the

          11          Indian tribe.

          12                When the Court issued an order the

          13          boards would remain out during the dry

          14          season -- don't remember which year it was

          15          now, '17 or so, '18 maybe -- the tribe

          16          petitioned the District and requested an

          17          emergency plug to be put into the canal so

          18          that they themselves could stage water on

          19          their land so that they could get the

          20          allocation of water that they --

          21                THE COURT:  They have the right to

          22          assert an amount of water --

          23                MR. JORGENSEN:  Correct.

          24                THE COURT:  -- a certain water flow

          25          amount or gallon of use.

                                                                   48




           1                MR. JORGENSEN:  Correct.  15 percent

           2          of the total amount of water in the Indian

           3          Prairie Basin or something like that.  And

           4          that's what they did.

           5                And it's my understanding in talking

           6          to the District that -- and then they went

           7          back and put in a more permanent structure.

           8          And that permanent structure -- well, it's

           9          not permanent but it's a more permanent

          10          looking structure.  That structure will

          11          remain unless and until PV Ranch is allowed

          12          to start staging water again at 18.5.  And

          13          then once that happens, out goes the Indian

          14          tribe's structure.

          15                So for over the years, you know,

          16          even from '63 on, double culverts have been

          17          used to stage water to allow for those

          18          consumptive use water permit holders west

          19          of the canal to use water.  And they were

          20          the ones who, you know, during that window

          21          of time -- two years -- they -- if they had

          22          a reasonable use of -- a reasonable common

          23          law use of the water, they could apply for

          24          a permit.  Those permits holders or those

          25          land owners upstream did so.  They got

                                                                   49




           1          permits from the District and they continue

           2          to have permits from the District and they

           3          use water from the L-59 canal as staged at

           4          the double culverts.

           5                D.L. Pearce Ranch did not apply for

           6          a permit.  I don't know if they could have

           7          gotten one if they had a reasonable use of

           8          water from the L-59 canal.  Perhaps the

           9          District would have granted them one but

          10          they didn't do it.  Instead they got a

          11          permit for Paradise Run.  There was an

          12          earlier version of the permit, I think,

          13          back in the 80s.  And then they got -- they

          14          renewed it in 2016.  I think it was dormant

          15          and then they filed an application to renew

          16          it.

          17                And so in 2016, they got their

          18          permit to use water from Paradise Run

          19          pumped, you know, out of the -- you know,

          20          obtained by pumping in the canal.  The

          21          records indicate that they never used it,

          22          that they calibrated it one time and I

          23          think they had a certain number of gallons

          24          in one month from the records that I got

          25          and they never used the pump out of

                                                                   50




           1          Paradise Run.

           2                So this case for cattle damages --

           3          incidentally, when we did discovery, the

           4          damages were 350,000 not 850.  And so this

           5          850 is a brand new number I've never heard

           6          before.

           7                THE COURT:  He said 800.  But...

           8                MR. JORGENSEN:  Well, whatever it

           9          was.  It was 350 before.

          10                So this is claim for -- they

          11          filed -- originally, they file an

          12          injunction action and a claim for damages.

          13          And then when the Court ruled that the

          14          boards would remain out for the pending

          15          action, they dropped the injunction action

          16          and they just brought a claim for damages

          17          to their cattle herd.  And the theory of

          18          their case is they were entitled to water

          19          from the 1962 stipulation and somehow by

          20          these boards being in place in the

          21          culverts, it affected the water flow to

          22          Paradise Run.  But I don't think the water

          23          flows from L-59 into Paradise Run, but that

          24          was their theory.  All right.

          25                And this stub canal business never

                                                                   51




           1          came up and I didn't know about.  I don't

           2          think my clients knew about it.  It was not

           3          part of their case.  It was not pled.  It

           4          was not in discovery.  And it didn't

           5          arise --

           6                MR. ESPY:  I think this is improper

           7          opening statement, your Honor.  I object.

           8                THE COURT:  Well, if the evidence

           9          shows it, it shows it.  If not, it doesn't.

          10                MR. JORGENSEN:  All right.  So,

          11          again, I don't think the evidence --

          12                THE COURT:  This is not evidence.  I

          13          don't consider it as such.

          14                MR. JORGENSEN:  In any event, I

          15          don't think the evidence is going to show

          16          that this stub canal was ever interjected

          17          as an issue or a fact issue throughout the

          18          course of this litigation until at the

          19          Motion for Summary Judgement hearing.

          20                So, I guess, we'll see what the

          21          evidence is and who knew what about the

          22          stub canal and how it may or may not effect

          23          the Court's prior rulings.

          24                But that's -- basically our case on

          25          water issues is that those risers or boards

                                                                   52




           1          have always been used.  They have always

           2          been used to stage water.  They have to

           3          be -- the water has to be staged there for

           4          the tribe to get its water and for the

           5          upstream, you know, permit holders who

           6          properly applied for a permit to use water.

           7          They have to have it there, too, otherwise

           8          it presents problems.

           9                Right now, the Indian tribe is in

          10          control.  They let out water when they --

          11          you know, when it's needed and they have

          12          the structure in place and they're running

          13          the show in the L-59 canal at moment.  When

          14          historically it's always been the double

          15          culverts.

          16                And, you know, my client filed --

          17          Jeanette Peeples and PV Ranch filed its

          18          claim -- those retired and being stuck in

          19          the middle.  I mean, they get blamed if

          20          they don't put the boards in by upstream

          21          water users including the Indian tribe.

          22          And if they put the boards in, then they

          23          get complaints from Pearce Ranch.  So

          24          they're kind of stuck in the middle.

          25                They have a right of way permit.

                                                                   53




           1          The permit does not regulate the use of the

           2          riders.  It's left up to PV Ranch's

           3          discretion according to the District.  And

           4          they use the boards to stage the water and

           5          the District says we don't have any part in

           6          that.  However, the District really needs

           7          to have those boards in place so that

           8          permit holders upstream can get their water

           9          that they're allowed to get under their

          10          permits.

          11                So that's kind of the mess of the

          12          water use issues from my client's

          13          perspective, from Jeanette Peeples'

          14          perspective who just wants this over with

          15          and doesn't want to be stuck in the middle

          16          of this tug-o-war between downstream and

          17          upstream water users.

          18                THE COURT:  All right.

          19                MR. JORGENSEN:  So as far as the --

          20          as the central easement, there's two

          21          issues.  One is the completion of the

          22          central for about the last quarter of a

          23          mile down to Highway 78.  It depends upon

          24          which direction -- you can start it at 78

          25          or you can end it at 78, whatever.

                                                                   54




           1                At the south end of the central

           2          easement, there's about a quarter of a mile

           3          that remains -- it's not improved.  There's

           4          no shell-rock road there.  And it's because

           5          the parties over the 28 years have never

           6          been able to agree or Mark Hunter Pearce

           7          individually won't agree to allow this

           8          easement to go -- to allow the central

           9          easement to be completed.

          10                When the 1995 stipulation was done,

          11          there was to have been a survey of the

          12          whole central easement and there wasn't one

          13          for several years.  There was one finally

          14          done by DeHayes Surveying in 2001 paid for

          15          by John Collier and filed with the court.

          16          That one shows -- and it's -- this map is

          17          based on it.  And I don't think there's any

          18          issue about the correctness of this map

          19          except for this last part down here.

          20          There's going to be a contention over this.

          21          But the rest of it just runs up the central

          22          easement until we get to the alternate

          23          easement.  That's another issue.

          24                So Plaintiffs is going to say that

          25          they have a survey from Leland Dials.  I'm

                                                                   55




           1          not sure when it was done.  Both surveys

           2          have been filed with the Court.  I would

           3          contend that the Leland Dials is a sketch,

           4          it's not a survey and it doesn't survey the

           5          entire central easement as is required by

           6          the 1995 stipulation.  Leland Dials has got

           7          this "Z" in it, which makes it impossible

           8          for my client who needs to use the central

           9          easement because she owns properties -- or

          10          PV Ranch owns properties up here in Section

          11          17, PV Ranch owns property in Section 20,

          12          and PV Ranch has joint ownership with Janet

          13          and Byron Storey in 29.

          14                So they need that central easement

          15          to run large trucks.  I mean, they lease

          16          out property for sod.  They lease out

          17          property for agriculture.  And if there's a

          18          sharp "Z" in this last quarter of the mile,

          19          large trucks can't make that maneuver.  So

          20          they would prefer to have the DeHayes

          21          survey, but they'll take any survey -- any

          22          reasonable route from the old windmill.

          23          And that's what the 1995 stipulation

          24          said -- from the old windmill down to

          25          Highway 78.  And there's a rough of it

                                                                   56




           1          shown on the 1995 stipulation just as a

           2          slanted line.

           3                They'll take any reasonable route

           4          from the old windmill down to Highway 78 so

           5          they can run their big trucks down there.

           6          And they have a right to use the central

           7          easement, period.  We think it should be

           8          the DeHayes survey but that's for the Court

           9          to determine.

          10                You'll hear that my client already

          11          paid a significant amount of money for

          12          engineering in cost because in order to

          13          complete this central easement down to

          14          Highway 78, there has to be -- you know,

          15          you've got to enter a highway.  There's

          16          engineering involved there.  I think we may

          17          have to have a turn lane.  So all that work

          18          has been done.  They're just waiting to

          19          complete this.  And this has been going on

          20          for 28 years to resolve this central

          21          easement issue.  But I think the language

          22          of the 1995 stipulation, you know, resolves

          23          that.

          24                The other issue in the central

          25          easement is use of this alternate easement

                                                                   57




           1          up here.  If the Court recalls previous

           2          testimony on this -- I know the hearings --

           3          there's an area of, like, swampy area up

           4          here once you get past this intersections

           5          of 20, 21, 16, and 17.  Going on up in

           6          here, it's not really passable.  So the

           7          road hasn't been built in the '95

           8          stipulation provided.  That unless that

           9          area is able to be navigated, people don't

          10          have to -- the land owners didn't have to

          11          set back their fences.

          12                So what happened was that the Court

          13          agreed that there would be an alternate

          14          easement done.  And the route is

          15          well-known.  It's stated in the '95

          16          stipulation 51 that it would run up here to

          17          the double culverts and then cross over the

          18          double culverts.  But, specifically, what

          19          the '95 stipulation states is that it's --

          20          that the easement is granted to John and

          21          Kim Collier and Juanelle Peeples.  It's not

          22          granted to anybody else.  So they're the

          23          only ones that have -- that were given this

          24          easement across this property, across the

          25          double culverts, and on up to what is

                                                                   58




           1          identified as the high grade.

           2                D.L. Pearce Ranch was not given an

           3          easement for the alternate easement.  It

           4          was only given to John and Kim Collier and

           5          to Juanelle Peeples.  And Juanelle Peeples

           6          is the mother of Jeanette Peeples and

           7          Jeanette owned it.  Then it was in a trust

           8          and now it's in PV Ranch -- that property

           9          up there.

          10                This property up to the north was

          11          owned by the Colliers.  It was subsequently

          12          conveyed to the District.  This is -- some

          13          properties up in the 17 and 18.  And if the

          14          Court recalls, we had a previous hearing on

          15          whether or not there's a gate up there just

          16          prior to the high grade and Pearce Ranch

          17          wanted that lock removed so it could go

          18          through the gate and go on up past the high

          19          grade and motor on up into these sections

          20          to the north.  And the Court denied the

          21          hearing -- or denied the removal of the

          22          locks and said until such time as Pearce

          23          Ranch has the prescriptive easement on

          24          these lands up in 17 and 18, he's not --

          25          you know, the Court said not going to

                                                                   59




           1          remove the lock.

           2                So that's -- those are the only two

           3          issues on this central easement that I

           4          believe exist is, again, just finishing it

           5          down to 78 and then determining who has any

           6          rights to the alternate easement.

           7                THE COURT:  All right.

           8                MR. JORGENSEN:  Thank you, Judge.

           9                THE COURT:  District.

          10                MS. BROWN:  Judge, I'm afraid you're

          11          stuck with me for opening and you've put me

          12          in a precarious situation of having to read

          13          my own handwriting.  So we'll see how that

          14          goes today.  So Alison Brown for the

          15          District.

          16                The evidence will show that

          17          Plaintiff does not have a right to draw

          18          water from the L-59 canal or any stub canal

          19          that water from the L-59 may flow into

          20          without a permit.  Plaintiff does not have

          21          a permit to draw that water and such

          22          permits are required by the Florida

          23          legislature.

          24                Now, Mr. Bruce Chesser is a

          25          superintendant of field operations for the

                                                                   60




           1          District here and I know a lot of folks in

           2          this room are familiar with him.  He'll

           3          testify about the Levee 59, its purpose,

           4          the District's right of way, and the

           5          District's ability to access both the north

           6          and south side of the canal.  He will also

           7          testify about the cutout on Plaintiff's

           8          property and others like it along the L-59

           9          canal and that those are used for drainage

          10          purposes only, not for drawing water.

          11                And thank you for your Honor's time.

          12                THE COURT:  Plaintiff call your

          13          first witness.

          14                MR. ESPY:  Your Honor, a couple of

          15          things before I call my first witness.  I

          16          would like to bring to the Court's

          17          attention there is a witness we have under

          18          subpoena named John Cook, he's a lawyer.

          19                THE COURT:  I saw that.

          20                MR. ESPY:  And he filed something

          21          with the Court late yesterday to say --

          22                THE COURT:  He did.

          23                MR. ESPY:  -- that he's got court

          24          appearances.  In lieu of his live

          25          testimony, we would like to introduce his

                                                                   61




           1          deposition during our case.  He actually --

           2          his testimony pertains to the easement

           3          issues but I admit to bring that up with

           4          the Court earlier.  I wanted to do it now

           5          so I could let him go.

           6                THE COURT:  He was subpoenaed and he

           7          did file a Notice of Unavailability.  He

           8          has to be in court elsewhere.

           9                MR. JORGENSEN:  I saw his motion.  I

          10          don't know if he's completely unavailable

          11          or not.

          12                THE COURT:  Well, he's not available

          13          until maybe later in the week.

          14                MR. JORGENSEN:  So...

          15                THE COURT:  Well, let's do this.

          16          See if he's available later in the week.

          17          If not, then I'll take his deposition.

          18                MR. ESPY:  I mean, he's more than

          19          100 miles away, too.

          20                THE COURT:  Where does he live?

          21                MR. ESPY:  DeLand.  He's moved to

          22          DeLand during --

          23                THE COURT:  That'll teach him to

          24          move.

          25                MR. JORGENSEN:  There's a couple of

                                                                   62




           1          letters that he wrote that I was going to

           2          have him introduce because he wrote the

           3          letters.

           4                THE COURT:  Let's see if we can get

           5          him down here.

           6                MR. JORGENSEN:  Maybe you can

           7          stipulate that they come in.  We'll see.

           8                MR. ESPY:  Yeah.  We'll work with

           9          him on that.

          10                THE COURT:  I know he's not

          11          available today but we'll see how it works

          12          later in the week.

          13                MR. ESPY:  And then before I -- I'd

          14          like to introduce some exhibits at the

          15          outset of my case.

          16                Exhibit 4 for identification.

          17                MS. STOKEN-BARING:  Your Honor,

          18          Paralegal Ashlie Stoken-Baring for the

          19          Plaintiffs.

          20                THE COURT:  Okay.  I don't know if

          21          congratulations or condolences are in

          22          order.

          23                MS. STOKEN-BARING:  Okay.

          24                MR. ESPY:  You guys want to -- this

          25          is the -- the Permit 22-00127.  You have

                                                                   63




           1          it?

           2                MR. JORGENSEN:  Yeah, that's fine.

           3                MR. BREWER:  There's about 15 of

           4          them.

           5                MR. ESPY:  All right.  So we would

           6          introduce Plaintiff's Exhibit 4, which is

           7          the permit that Mr. Pearce did have, into

           8          evidence at this time or ask to be admit

           9          it.

          10                THE COURT:  Any objection?

          11                MR. JORGENSEN:  No, your Honor.

          12                MR. GLASS:  No, your Honor.

          13                THE COURT:  Plaintiff's 4 will be

          14          admitted.

          15                (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 4 was

          16          offered into evidence and received by the

          17          Court.)

          18                MR. ESPY:  And Exhibit 30.  And this

          19          is the -- this is the '62 agreement.

          20                MS. BROWN:  Your Honor, just to

          21          quick question:  How are these being

          22          marked?  Is the first one prior to this

          23          one -- what's the exhibit number?

          24                THE COURT:  I've got the clerk

          25          marking them.  She's marked it as

                                                                   64




           1          Plaintiff's 4.

           2                MS. BROWN:  Plaintiff's 4?

           3                THE COURT:  That's what he

           4          indicated.

           5                MS. BROWN:  Okay.  Thank you.

           6                MR. ESPY:  Exhibit 30 for

           7          identification is the '62 agreement.  We

           8          would ask to introduce that at this time.

           9                You have it?  I have an extra copy.

          10                MR. JORGENSEN:  Based on the Court's

          11          ruling, I have no objection but I would

          12          raise the objection that --

          13                THE COURT:  Understood.  Understood.

          14                MR. ESPY:  All right.  We would

          15          next --

          16                (Simultaneously speaking.)

          17                THE COURT:  -- will be admitted.

          18          What impact it has is for the Court to

          19          determine.

          20                (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 30 was

          21          offered into evidence and received by the

          22          Court.)

          23                MR. ESPY:  All right.

          24                THE COURT:  That's 30?

          25                MR. ESPY:  Yes, sir.

                                                                   65




           1                Next Exhibits 37 through 42.  37 is

           2          correspondence from Jeanette Peeples dated

           3          February 23, -- not 37.  Pardon me.  38 is

           4          correspondence from Mark Hunter Pearce to

           5          John Hixenbaugh at the District regarding

           6          the L-59 canal.

           7                THE COURT:  At the top of this, it

           8          says Exhibit 4A.  We're just designated

           9          this as 4?

          10                MR. ESPY:  It's just 4.  I think we

          11          had it listed twice that's why she called

          12          it 4A.

          13                MR. JORGENSEN:  What's the number on

          14          that one?  What number is that?

          15                MR. ESPY:  38.

          16                MR. JORGENSEN:  Did you introduce 37

          17          through 42 or just --

          18                MR. ESPY:  No, 38 is where I'm --

          19                MR. JORGENSEN:  Okay.

          20                MR. ESPY:  Do you guys have any

          21          objection to 38?

          22                MR. JORGENSEN:  I'll note the same

          23          objection of relevance based on the Court's

          24          prior Motions for Summary Judgement.

          25                THE COURT:  Understood.

          11          same running objection, your Honor.

           9          Jeanette Peeples in which the District

          10          advises her that the operation of the

          12          discretion of the permittee, PV Ranch LLC.

          17          an objection per se, but there were

          18          attachments to this letter in the original.

          19          So I don't know if that makes a difference

          20          to the Court.

           6          before we get started?

           7                THE COURT:  Sure.  Stand down.

           8                THE BAILIFF:  All rise.  Court is in

          16          Q.    And how old are you, sir?

          17          A.    They told me I'm 67.  I was born in

          18   '56.

          19          Q.    Okay.  Please give the Court sort of

          20   a brief summary so he can understand your

          21   experience as a cattleman?

          22          A.    I've been a cattleman or a cowboy my

          23   entire life.  I was trained by my daddy and my

          24   granddaddy.  They've been in the cattle business

          25   here since the late fifties.  I eat, drink, and

                                                                   70

           6          Q.    Now, your father's name was what,

           7   sir?

           8          A.    D.L. Pearce.

           9          Q.    He was a cattleman too, I think you

          10   said?

          11          A.    Yes, he was.  That's all he knew.

          12          Q.    And we have the '62 agreement in

          13   evidence.  Your daddy was a party to that '62

          14   lawsuit?

          15          A.    Yes, he was.

          16          Q.    And that '62 agreement makes

          17   reference to him individually And the L Cross

          18   Ranch.  Do you recall that?

          19          A.    Yes, sir.  In the beginning, the

          20   L Cross Ranch was just what it says -- the

          21   L Cross Ranch.  My granddaddy owned it all.  And

          22   when his time went by, they give land to the

          23   grandchildren and their children and my daddy

          24   received some of his land in the fifties.

          25          Q.    And your granddaddy, what was his

                                                                   71




           1   name?

           2          A.    Austin Pearce.

           3          Q.    And D.L. Pearce Ranch, Inc., is the

           4   Plaintiff in this case.  Is that a direct

           5   descendant of the L Cross Ranch?

           6          A.    Daddy started the corporation in

           7   '81.

           8          Q.    And you are the President of

           9   D.L. Pearce Ranch, Inc.?

          11          Q.    And you were in 2016?

          12          A.    Yes, sir.

          15          Q.    What is your relation to

          19          Q.    And can you describe -- I want you

          20   to show the Court where the double culverts are.

          21   Would it assist you if we put something up on the

          22   easel or computer?

          23          A.    If it'll assist the judge.

          24          Q.    Okay?

          25          A.    That easel is back yonder, Alan,

                                                                   72




           1   behind that white post.  I put it there myself.

           2                MR. ESPY:  With the Court's

           3          permission.

           4                THE COURT:  Go ahead, sir.

           5                MR. ESPY:  Mr. Pearce, I'd like to

           6          ask you to step -- yeah, that's fine.

           7          Okay.

           8                THE WITNESS:  Your Honor, this map

           9          is -- it comes from South Florida Water

          10          Management.

          11                THE COURT:  If you want to, you

          12          could step down and point on the map with

          13          your finger, if you want to.

          14                THE WITNESS:  Whatever you want to

          15          do.  It's what's best for you.

          16                THE COURT:  It might be easier --

          17                MR. ESPY:  There's a glare on it.

          18          It might be easier if you point at it.

          19                THE WITNESS:  This is a map that I

          20          got from South Florida Water Management.

          21          The L-59 starts down here at C-30 -- or

          22          C-40, excuse me, Indian Prairie Canal.

          23          That's the source of water is a screw gate

          24          there, Permit Number 1695.  And that permit

          25          is titled to Keith Pearce, John Austin

                                                                   73




           1          Collier, and Byron Storey.  So all the

           2          water all the way across here, nine and a

           3          half miles, is controlled by that screw

           4          gate.  That's the only water that comes

           5          into the L-59 canal.

           6                This map is showing when they

           7          started the permitting in eighties.  I

           8          don't know the exact year -- '87 or maybe

           9          before that.  Right after my grandma and

          10          granddad died in '81 or '82.  These

          11          permits, these -- it tells if they was

          12          revoked or issued another permit.  Most of

          13          them was taken out.

          14                Keith Pearce has a permit here.  And

          15          today Twin Sisters, which is John Austin

          16          Collier, Byron Storey, and Jeanette Peeples

          17          has a permit here.  That is a permit for

          18          this land in here.

          19   BY MR. ESPY:

          20          Q.    Which is not the land that this case

          21   is about?

          22          A.    No.  No, I was just explaining to

          23   the Judge there's only two culverts with water

          24   exiting the L-59.  At the far end of L-59 is

          25   C-38, which is Kissimmee River.  And,

                                                                   74




           1   approximately -- well, that's actually way over

           2   here.  C-38 is right here.

           3                This -- I call it the squiggly line

           4   is Paradise Run.  Paradise Run is connected to

           5   the L-59 on the north side of L-59.  By the way,

           6   L-59 is not like Kissimmee River or the

           7   Caloosahatchee River or any prairie canal.  It

           8   don't have a dyke down both sides of it.  It only

           9   has a dyke on the south side.  It's ground level

          10   on the north side.

          11          Q.    And that's Levee 59?

          12          A.    L-59.  That's why -- the "L" stands

          13   for levee and the "C" at C-40 and C-38 stands for

          14   canals.

          15                The levee was put up as a secondary

          16   dyke to the Hoover Dyke that runs around Lake

          17   Okeechobee.  Because all this water, that sheet

          18   flowed from the north and the northwest was

          19   called the Brighton Slew.  And all that water

          20   come down through here.  And, then, if you had a

          21   lot of rain, which I've seen as much as 22 and a

          22   half inches at one time in my life, when it comes

          23   down, they put this dyke across here to L-59 to

          24   slow that water down.

          25                L-59 was originally made to transfer

                                                                   75




           1   water, but it came into that over the years.

           2   When they put this L-59 in, it severed the

           3   Brighton Slew which furnished the water to all

           4   the Pearce family, approximately 20,000 acres.

           5   So that's when they had to go back and put these

           6   culverts in at my granddaddy's request because

           7   he'd been out there horseback all his life, he

           8   knows where the water needed to go.  So they put

           9   those culverts in there.

          10                The double culverts -- let's see --

          11   are right here.  Right here.

          12          Q.    Just past this little bend here?

          13          A.    Yes.  There's a bend down there all

          14   200 yards to the west.  The double culverts was

          15   put there for the purpose of separating the high

          16   ground from the marshland.  You can go there

          17   today, even though there's no boards in it, and

          18   when you stand on those culverts, you can look to

          19   the east -- and I've got better maps than this to

          20   show that the land drops off.  I've got a topo

          21   map to show the elevation.

          22                But when this canal was put in in

          23   '62 -- '61 or '62, they put the double culverts

          24   in and it says for better water control for the

          25   Pearce family.  When you put these boards in

                                                                   76




           1   here --

           2          Q.    Now, you're pointing -- for the

           3   record, when you say put them in here, you're

           4   pointing --

           5          A.    At the double culverts.

           6                When you put the boards in the

           7   double culvert, naturally the water backs up if

           8   they open 1695 and let water in.  Back in -- when

           9   this was put in, there was no control of the

          10   water.  It was just rainfall.  So that was the

          11   purpose of that.

          12          Q.    Now, where's the stub canal that you

          13   heard us talking about this morning in relation

          14   to the double culverts?

          15          A.    Well, it's hard to see because of

          16   this glare right here.  But this is your section

          17   line.  It's 7,200-and-something feet to the east

          18   of that.  So I'd say it's right along in here

          19   someplace.

          20          Q.    Okay.  And how far is the stub canal

          21   from the C-38?

          22          A.    One mile, give or take a few feet.

          23          Q.    Just about exactly?

          24          A.    Yes.

          25          Q.    Now, how long has the stub canal --

                                                                   77




           1   and that's on your property; correct?

           2          A.    Yes, sir.

           3          Q.    And is that Section 16?

           4          A.    Yes.

           5          Q.    And, by the way, all this real

           6   estate we're looking at here on this blow up is

           7   in Glades County, Florida?

           8          A.    Oh, yeah.  Everything west of

           9   Kissimmee River is.

          10          Q.    And east of the Kissimmee River is

          11   Okeechobee County?

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    So how long has this stub canal

          14   existed?

          15          A.    My entire life.  I've got a map

          16   there to show, if you want to show it.  The stub

          17   canal was in there in '61 in January.  No, in

          18   '57.  And then in '61 when they started the L-59,

          19   it's still there.  And when in '62 -- in

          20   December '62 when they finished it, it's still

          21   there.

          22          Q.    And has it been there continuously?

          23          A.    You might want to look at that map.

          24          Q.    Has it been there continuously since

          25   '62?

                                                                   78




           1          A.    Yes.

           2          Q.    What has the stub canal been used

           3   for during those -- during that --

           4          A.    Well, right after the war,

           5   World War II, my granddaddy went into the mater

           6   farming business -- Pearce Produce.  And that's

           7   why the tomater grades go to tomater -- because

           8   that's where they hold the tomaters at.  And just

           9   a rough figure, they was between 2,500 and 3,000

          10   acres of tomaters on that ranch.  And every

          11   tomater farm was planted on the white sand.  You

          12   don't grow tomaters in mud.

          13                So in order to do that, they had to

          14   dyke off the white sand from the marshland.  And

          15   the stub canal is the eastern side of

          16   approximately 400 acres -- no, approximately 600

          17   acres of tomater farms.  So all these tomater

          18   farms was watered by artesian wells.  They was

          19   put down in the late -- '48, '49.  And in dry

          20   times, they used the well to water these tomater

          21   farms.  It's all in here.

          22                You can -- even on this map -- see

          23   the little checkerboards.  I've got a better map

          24   if we put it up.  Every one of them

          25   checkerboards, that's where tomater farms was.

                                                                   79




           1   You didn't have to worry about water except in

           2   dry times because the Brighton Slew was right

           3   here.  And all they did was -- they had -- I

           4   don't even know if they had culverts back then.

           5   I don't see no traces of culverts.  But they just

           6   cut the dyke, let the water come in there for

           7   watermelons, I guess.  I don't know about that.

           8                But go ahead.

           9          Q.    Well, so we're talking about the

          10   stub canal.  When did your -- actually, I got a

          11   little ahead of myself?

          12                This property we're looking at back

          13   in '62, was it all owned by your grandfather at

          14   that time or most of it?

          15          A.    No, that was owned by D.L. Pearce in

          16   '62.

          17          Q.    Okay.

          18          A.    I think.  No, I'm not going to say

          19   that.

          20          Q.    Okay.

          21          A.    It was in the family.

          22          Q.    Well, that was what I was trying to

          23   ask?

          24                Over time, the property has been

          25   bequeathed to other family members?

                                                                   80




           1          A.    Yes.

           2                THE COURT:  Sir, you go ahead and

           3          have a seat again.  I'm not sure we'll be

           4          referring to the map anymore.

           5   BY MR. ESPY:

           6          Q.    Is there another map that you have

           7   that you think is --

           8          A.    Absolutely.

           9          Q.    Can you pull it out and we'll --

          10          A.    You got it right there.  It's right

          11   there in front of it.

          12                THE WITNESS:  Can you see that,

          13          Judge?  You better come down here, too.

          14                THE COURT:  No, I can see.

          15   BY MR. ESPY:

          16          Q.    While they're looking at that, let

          17   me ask you.  Does water in the L-59 borrow canal

          18   down in the area where the stub canal is, does it

          19   normally flow from the west to east or it goes

          20   towards the C-38?

          21          A.    Absolutely.

          22          Q.    Okay.

          23          A.    Water don't run uphill.

          24                THE COURT:  That's southwest and

          25          northeast.

                                                                   81




           1                MR. ESPY:  Did I get that wrong?

           2                THE WITNESS:  More or less.

           3          According to what time -- what time of year

           4          or where the sun comes up at.

           5                MR. ESPY:  Are you guys okay with us

           6          proceeding?

           7                MR. JORGENSEN:  PV Ranch is okay

           8          with it.

           9   BY MR. ESPY:

          10          Q.    Tell us, Mr. Pearce, what these maps

          11   that you just placed on the easel are?

          12          A.    This is depicting -- I wanted the

          13   Court to see tomater farms.  And all of these

          14   checkerboards they all call it is old tomater

          15   fields.

          16          Q.    Is that the red checkerboard?

          17          A.    They're outlined there because

          18   that's depicting on my property.  There's more

          19   maps there.  But even on this, you can see all

          20   these checkerboards over here.  Here.  That's

          21   called the Curve Pasture.  All here.  All these

          22   checkerboards, that's old tomater farm.

          23          Q.    And why is it you want to emphasize

          24   that?

          25          A.    Well, because as I said previously,

                                                                   82




           1   all these tomater farms was dyked on the outside

           2   of them to keep water from coming to them and

           3   rotten their tomaters when it rained.

           4          Q.    Before the L-59?

           5          A.    Absolutely.

           6                So they're still there, there just

           7   ain't no maters growing there.  But the stub

           8   canal was right here.  Right there.

           9          Q.    And the double culverts are where?

          10          A.    Right there.  No, right there.

          11          Q.    Right at that bend?

          12          A.    Yes.  There's a white mark right

          13   there for the culverts.

          14          Q.    Okay.

          15          A.    So in order to get rid of the water

          16   before the dyke was in there, it traveled around

          17   this way around the outside of the tomater farms

          18   and it flows to the south.  All the water flows

          19   to the south.  So when they put the L-59 in, the

          20   stub canal was there -- and it's hearsay.  But

          21   Daddy said Charlie Leitner was running the drag

          22   line.  And he told him he wanted that dug deeper

          23   and bigger.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  Objection; hearsay,

          25          your Honor.

                                                                   83




           1                THE WITNESS:  That's why I said it's

           2          hearsay.  That was a long time ago.

           3   BY MR. ESPY:

           4          Q.    All right.  But your point is the

           5   stub canal was there when these were tomater

           6   farms?

           7          A.    Absolutely.  That's what it was put

           8   in there for.

           9          Q.    Okay.  And at any time after the

          10   L-59 borrow canal was constructed, did the South

          11   Florida Water Management District or its

          12   predecessor ever indicate to you or your daddy

          13   that you're aware of a desire to wall that off or

          14   close it in?

          15          A.    No, you can't wall it off.  There

          16   would be no drainage.

          17          Q.    You've heard the term used "breach,"

          18   that that was a breach?

          19          A.    First time I heard it was last year

          20   right here when the Judge turned that map around

          21   right there and asked Mr. Glass what this was,

          22   and that young lady right there whispered in his

          23   ear it's a breach.  I didn't know what a breach

          24   was until I got home and looked it up.

          25          Q.    Well, I mean, is the stub canal, as

                                                                   84




           1   you've described it that's the subject of this

           2   case, is that a breach of the L-59 borrowed

           3   canal?

           4          A.    No, it ain't no breach.  It's been

           5   there before the canal was there.

           6          Q.    And over the years, to what use have

           7   you made of the stub canal?  What purpose has it

           8   served since --

           9          A.    Daddy put a pump in there in '65 or

          10   '66 with a stationary pump.  That was the purpose

          11   of telling Charlie Leitner to dig it out to put a

          12   pump up there.  And he put a pump at the end of

          13   that stub canal.  That stub canal is only about

          14   125 and 150 yards long.

          15                And he put a pump there because in

          16   order to water this 386 acres, I think there

          17   is -- as I said, were a tomater farm.  So if you

          18   know anything about farming, you know that's

          19   higher than marshland.  So there's a topo map

          20   we'll present after a while that shows that this

          21   tomater farm land was higher than this marshland.

          22   So in order to water this grass and this 386

          23   acres, you got to take a pump and pump it up on

          24   top of that.

          25          Q.    I may have asked you this already

                                                                   85




           1   that already.  But since the property was

           2   converted to raising cattle, what purpose has a

           3   stub canal served?

           4          A.    If you don't have no water, you

           5   don't have no grass.  Everybody thinks water is

           6   just for -- like, South Florida Water Management.

           7   They offer to put me a solar panel over there.

           8   Cost $4,500 with a trough there.  I ain't worried

           9   about drinking water.  I'm worried about water to

          10   grow grass.  If you don't have no grass, you

          11   don't have very good cattle.  And by the way --

          12          Q.    So the irrigation, I assume, is sort

          13   of what you're --

          14          A.    That's the proper word.

          15                When my permit -- when they started

          16   permitting I think in '72 or '77, they did not

          17   give Daddy a permit to pump out the L-59 Canal.

          18   So he moved his permit to right here, where this

          19   oxbow is.  Where this oxbow is.  Because, believe

          20   it or not, Paradise Run is deeper -- the bottom

          21   of the canal, the old river, is deeper than the

          22   bottom of the L-59.  So any water that comes down

          23   L-59 flows in this area.  It flows north up the

          24   old river.

          25                MR. JORGENSEN:  Objection, your

                                                                   86




           1          Honor.  He's testifying as an expert.  He

           2          may be qualified based on his experience

           3          and knowledge of the land, but that hasn't

           4          been established.

           5                THE COURT:  You want to ask some

           6          predicate questions?

           7   BY MR. ESPY:

           8          Q.    Well, are you familiar with the

           9   nature of the land in the area that you're

          10   describing?

          11          A.    Been on it my whole life.

          12          Q.    You worked it your whole life?

          13          A.    -- a square foot I ain't put my foot

          14   on.  And I can tell you how deep that river is

          15   because I've killed gators in it my whole life.

          16          Q.    I'll submit that as -- -

          17                THE COURT:  But only with a permit;

          18          right?

          19                THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.  My youngin

          20          is a professional gator hunter.

          21                MR. ESPY:  We'd hate to lose you

          22          before lunch.  All right.  Continue,

          23          Mr. Pearce.

          24                THE COURT:  Well, let me ask --

          25          sorry to interrupt.  Since this is a civil

                                                                   87




           1          case, I get to ask questions.

           2                How do you know that Paradise Run is

           3          deeper than the L-59?

           4                THE WITNESS:  Because I drove cattle

           5          across it.  I've swam it my whole life.  I

           6          waded in it.  I've got a youngin right

           7          there that hog hunts on both sides of it

           8          and he'll tell you how deep it is.

           9                THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.

          10   BY MR. ESPY:

          11          Q.    What was the status of Paradise Run

          12   in terms of the water in it back in 2016, 2017?

          13          A.    There wasn't no water.  There was no

          14   status of any water.

          15          Q.    There wasn't any water in it?

          16          A.    If they shut the water off with the

          17   boards, if that's what you --

          18                THE COURT:  No, no, no.  You missed

          19          his question.  In Paradise Run, was there

          20          water.

          21                THE WITNESS:  No, sir.  Because the

          22          water has to -- that water has to come from

          23          L-59.  And, yes, it was deeper, but it was

          24          a drought so bad that the shad died in it,

          25          your Honor.  The fish died in the L-50 -- I

                                                                   88




           1          mean, in Paradise Run.

           2                MR. ESPY:  In 2016?

           3                THE WITNESS:  It's not as deep as

           4          Kissimmee River, but it's deeper than the

           5          L-59.  Yes, sir.

           6                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  So just to --

           7                THE WITNESS:  We was in a major

           8          drought.  And it was not God given.  It was

           9          man-made drought.

          10   BY MR. ESPY:

          11          Q.    And tell us what you base that

          12   statement on?

          13          A.    Well, they put the boards in the

          14   double culvert and cut my water off.

          15          Q.    Okay.  All right?

          16                So in the winter 2016, early 2017,

          17   the time period that we're concerned with, was

          18   Paradise Run dry?

          19          A.    Not bone dry, no, sir.  But there

          20   wasn't enough water to pump.

          21          Q.    Okay.  Now let me show you -- are

          22   there any other -- before we have you sit down,

          23   any other illustrations that are here that you

          24   want to show the Court that would help you

          25   explain --

                                                                   89




           1          A.    Well, I want to back up just a

           2   minute.  I was telling a while ago about this 386

           3   acres.  The permit that I have today is permitted

           4   from 386 acres down from 950.  When the pump was

           5   up here in Paradise Run, I was watering

           6   everything that's yellow down to L-59.

           7                So when they cut my water off, I

           8   knew that I should be able to get water through

           9   these culverts eventually.  I know a lot more

          10   today than I did in the beginning of 16 when

          11   they'd done it.  But I moved my permit down to

          12   what we call the stub canal because my main

          13   concern was this 386 acres here.  The marshland

          14   is black muck.  So it stays saturated more than

          15   white sand does.

          16                Is that good enough for you, Judge?

          17                THE COURT:  I understand.

          18                THE WITNESS:  Okay.  So that's why

          19          my permit was moved down here.

          20          Technically, if I put my permit -- if I put

          21          my pump in at this -- at Paradise Run,

          22          they'd fine me for pumping water on the

          23          property that's not permitted because it

          24          went from 950 acres to 386 acres.

                                                                   90




           1   BY MR. ESPY:

           2          Q.    Now let me show you -- unless

           3   there's something else you want to show, I want

           4   to have you look at these photographs that I have

           5   marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 for

           6   identification.  It's a Composite exhibit?

           7          A.    Okay.  They backwards, but okay.

           8          Q.    All right.  And now do these

           9   photographs depict the property areas you've been

          10   describing?

          11          A.    Yes, sir.

          12          Q.    Okay.

          13          A.    No, this is the stub canal now.

          14          Q.    Yeah, I know.  I want to get it into

          15   evidence and then I want to give the Court a copy

          16   of it so he can see what you're looking at?

          17                But I first --

          18          A.    This is the stub canal.  This is

          19   from -- what do you call them little helicopters.

          20                MS. STOKEN-BARING:  Aerial.

          21                MR. ESPY:  Drone.

          22                THE WITNESS:  Yeah, drone.

          23                That's my pickup truck.  That's an

          24          old horse tractor and a pump back out in

          25          the canal right there.  These are chlorine

                                                                   91




           1          drums that we put across here because the

           2          water wiring wasn't good anymore.  It

           3          rusted out so fast to keep the cows from

           4          coming on to their property.

           5                MR. ESPY:  This photograph -- and

           6          can the Court see that?

           7                THE COURT:  I can.  I've seen it

           8          already.  It was introduced in the hearing

           9          on the Motion for Summary Judgment.

          10                MS. STOKEN-BARING:  If you want

          11          anything pulled up, we can do it on the

          12          screen.

          13                THE COURT:  All right.  I'm familiar

          14          with it.

          15                MR. ESPY:  We don't need this --

          16                THE WITNESS:  This is the same photo

          17          just a whole lot better than that one.

          18   BY MR. ESPY:

          19          Q.    And these were taken in June of this

          20   year, were they not?

          21          A.    June 22nd or 23rd.

          22          Q.    Okay.

          23          A.    And some of them -- yeah, this one

          24   here, I got a question if I can prove that's

          25   where that was.  So there's your longitude and

                                                                   92




           1   latitude.  You pull it up on your phone to see if

           2   I'm lying or not.

           3          Q.    Okay.

           4          A.    This is just more pictures.  I was

           5   hoping you'd come out there, Judge.  I painted

           6   the old tractor and pump for you.

           7                THE COURT:  I think I've probably

           8          seen enough browsing aerials that I have a

           9          pretty good idea of the layout.

          10                THE WITNESS:  This is a portable

          11          pump, Judge.  There's a rubber hose that

          12          connects to this -- an 18-inch hose.  And I

          13          go over -- it wasn't quite long enough, so

          14          I had to put a plastic pipe on the end of

          15          it, make it run to the canal.

          16                By the way, right here -- and let me

          17          show you this one.  This so called breach

          18          is nothing right there.  But when you pump

          19          this water, it goes all the way around that

          20          tomater farm there, 386 acres.  But in wet

          21          times, you pull the boards in this culvert

          22          right here and it comes right around here

          23          to the L-59.  So there's another breach

          24          right there.

                                                                   93




           1          Paradise Run.  Hard to see.  You can say,

           2          well, that's grass right there, but it's

           3          hyacinth.  You can see open water here.

           4          But it meanders around all the way around

           5          here.  Obviously -- I don't know.  Water

           6          has flowed down here -- when the water

           7          flows, the rainwater that collected way up

           8          here flows into Paradise Run.  It comes

           9          down here, goes out G-74, the number's been

          10          changed to 266, goes into Kissimmee River

          11          right here at the end of L-59 on the east

          12          end.

          13                So the water comes out and goes that

          14          way.  That's why it's pushed all these

          15          hyacinth down here.  But you can also see

          16          here there's three-quarter of a mile of

          17          so-called breach right here north of the

          18          L-59.  That's just all marshland there.

          19                So if there's maintenance that needs

          20          to be done, they got to start at Kissimmee

          21          River and move to the double culvert.  This

          22          is just a little better picture.  It's got

          23          more open water at the end of Paradise Run

          24          where -- or the old Kissimmee River where

          25          it joins L-59 here.

           1   BY MR. ESPY:

           2          Q.    All these photographs were taken in

           3   June of this year?

           4                THE COURT:  Let me see the last

           5          photograph.

           6                THE WITNESS:  Always go by that

           7          cabbage tree, Judge.  That cabbage ain't

           8          going to move.

           9   BY MR. ESPY:

          10          Q.    All these photos in Exhibit 5 were

          11   taken in June of 2023; is that right?

          12          A.    June 22nd.

          13                This is -- the L-59 used to run

          14   straight right through here in the Kissimmee

          15   River.  Now, in the last three or four years,

          16   they diverted around here and put a $33 million

          17   spillway in there when there was nothing wrong

          18   with wrong with one that was in there, but they

          19   got a fancy spillway here.  So that's why the

          20   canal doesn't run straight anymore.  It runs

          21   around here to 266.

          22                This is an even better picture.

          23   That same old cabbage tree that shows the L-59

          24   running into Paradise Run.  And that's about the

          25   gist of it.

                                                                   95




           1                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  We would offer

           2          Composite Exhibit 5 consistent with the

           3          photographs he's just been describing in

           4          evidence at this time.

           5                MR. JORGENSEN:  I do have an

           6          objection in light of predicate.  I don't

           7          know who took the photos or how it was

           8          done.

           9   BY MR. ESPY:

          10          Q.    Mr. Pearce, do the photographs that

          11   you just described in Plaintiff's Exhibit 5

          12   fairly and accurately depict the areas that

          13   you've been describing at the time those

          14   photographs were taken in June of this year?

          15          A.    Well, I don't know how you lie about

          16   a picture.  But, yes, they do.

          17                THE COURT:  They'll be admitted.

          18                (Plaintiff's Composite Exhibit

          19          Number 5 was offered into evidence and

          20          received by the Court.)

          21                THE WITNESS:  They used to say a

          22          picture was worth a 1,000 words.

          23   BY MR. ESPY:

          24          Q.    Over the years, once the L-59 borrow

          25   canal went in and the double culverts were

                                                                   96




           1   installed in '62, '63, around that time frame --

           2          A.    Okay.

           3          Q.    -- how was the operation of the

           4   boards handled in the first --

           5          A.    Me and my daddy, the only two people

           6   ever adjusted them boards in any way, shape,

           7   fashion or form because we was the only

           8   landowners that could get water out of there.

           9   Johnny Pearce owned land up there, 1,600 acres,

          10   but there was never a culvert put in the south

          11   side where the dyke is.  For that -- there was no

          12   culverts put in east of the double culverts for

          13   water to flow from the L-59 south except when you

          14   get all the way down to the east end.  The flood

          15   control has a structure called PC-1 and that

          16   allows water to come out of L-59 and continue

          17   down to Highway 78 of the Old Kissimmee River.

          18   In other words, Paradise Run, the Old Kissimmee

          19   River was severed by the L-59.  And they put PC-1

          20   structure in to allow water to flow towards 78.

          21          Q.    And the reason I asked you that

          22   question was that during these years that your

          23   dad and you were pulling the boards and placing

          24   the boards, were there any disputes with the

          25   family?

                                                                   97




           1          A.    None whatsoever.

           2          Q.    How many years did you and your dad

           3   operate those boards?

           4          A.    Well, it was put in in '62.  And by

           5   '81, there was no reason to have boards.  The

           6   risers was rusted off of it.  Got letters from

           7   the flood control asking Rosa Lee Pearce Trust to

           8   replace the risers.

           9          Q.    And when you use the term "flood

          10   control," you're referring to the South Florida

          11   Water Management?

          12          A.    That's what they call.

          13          Q.    And then the culverts and risers,

          14   were they replaced at that time?

          15          A.    No, they rusted off.  They was gone

          16   by '81.  So there was no restriction on any water

          17   at that double culverts just like there's not

          18   today after all the boards was out.  And then me

          19   and my daddy replaced them culverts in '95.  I

          20   got pictures that show that.

          21                And then --

          22          Q.    And in '95, who was placing and

          23   removing --

          24          A.    That was Rosa Lee Pearce Trust.

          25          Q.    Who was placing and removing the

                                                                   98




           1   boards in that time frame?  Is that still your

           2   father and you that were?

           3          A.    Yes.  Nobody else had any reason to

           4   mess with the board.

           5          Q.    Anyone in the family ever object to

           6   it?

           7          A.    No, sir.

           8          Q.    Okay.  So in '95, the culverts are

           9   replaced is that what you said?

          10          A.    '95, they were replaced.

          11          Q.    Okay.  They were replaced once again

          12   after that?

          13          A.    And I'm not sure about that year.  I

          14   think it was -- I want to say 2001.  But they was

          15   replaced again.  No.  No, that ain't right.

          16                The culverts replaced in '95.  And

          17   then in 2011, I think it was, they were rusted

          18   out again.

          19          Q.    Okay.

          20          A.    Culverts suppose to last 20, 25

          21   years.  Those didn't quite make it.

          22          Q.    Okay.  Something happened to them?

          23          A.    Something happened to them.  Letters

          24   to that effect, too.  But the purpose of the

          25   culverts being rusted out in 2011 is because

                                                                   99




           1   Jeanette Peeples become owner of that property.

           2          Q.    Of what property?

           3          A.    Of where PV Ranch is now in.

           4          Q.    In relation to the double culverts,

           5   is that --

           6          A.    She owns the double culverts,

           7   according to the permitting by South Florida

           8   Water Management.

           9          Q.    Okay.

          10          A.    So in order to get control of those

          11   culverts, they was replaced in kind in her name.

          12          Q.    Now, up until 2000 -- so we talked

          13   about the 2011 time frame.  At that point, the

          14   double culverts had been there almost 50 years?

          15          A.    One more time.

          16          Q.    By 2011 -- '63 to 2011 is almost 50

          17   years that they had been --

          18          A.    Okay.  I agree with you.

          19          Q.    And had there been any dispute about

          20   the boards going in or the boards being taken out

          21   between any family members?

          22          A.    Never was a dispute about water,

          23   except when Johnny Pearce put his orange grove in

          24   and he tried to cut everybody's water off by

          25   putting his orange grove in.  There was a dispute

                                                                   100




           1   there.

           2          Q.    Okay.  When was that?

           3          A.    In the late eighties, I think.

           4          Q.    Okay.  But that doesn't have --

           5          A.    I'm not sure.

           6          Q.    That doesn't have anything to do

           7   with what we're talking about?

           8          A.    No.

           9          Q.    Now, during that period of time --

          10   '63 to let's say 2011 -- did the Water Management

          11   District or its predecessor ever voice to you any

          12   objection or problem or complaint they had with

          13   you drawing water out of that stub canal?

          14          A.    No, sir.

          15          Q.    In fact --

          16          A.    But now we've got to clarify.  The

          17   pump in the stub canal was put in when I was a

          18   little boy.  I'd say about 60 -- well, eight --

          19   '64.  So from '64 until -- they'll have to tell

          20   me what year they started this permitting, '77,

          21   somewhere along that -- there was a pump in the

          22   stub canal.  And then when they started

          23   permitting, they moved it up to Paradise Run.

          24   Now, why daddy done that, I don't know.

          25          Q.    Was there ever any formal objection

                                                                   101




           1   you received from the District about --

           2          A.    Nothing whatsoever.  Never had a

           3   problem out of the District until this stuff come

           4   up.

           5          Q.    Okay.  Let me -- just for the

           6   record?

           7          A.    Okay.

           8          Q.    The question was:  Did you ever have

           9   any complaint or objection from the District

          10   about you removing water from the stub canal for

          11   irrigation purposes?

          12          A.    None whatsoever.

          13          Q.    So I want to direct your attention

          14   now to the time period at issue, 2016?

          15                Is it fair to describe the winter of

          16   2016 as a particularly dry period?

          17          A.    Not in God's terms; but by man, it

          18   was.

          19          Q.    Okay.  And I guess my question was

          20   sort of poorly phrased, but it should have been

          21   more directed?

          22                To you as a cattleman on your

          23   property, was it particularly dry that winter?

          24          A.    Yes.

          25          Q.    And what kind of problems does that

                                                                   102




           1   present for you?

           2          A.    When it's dry.

           3          Q.    Yes, sir?

           4          A.    Ain't got no grass.  Now, they going

           5   to stand up there and say, well, we got the

           6   rainfall.  They're going to testify sometime.  It

           7   can rain ten inches on Highway 78 and it won't

           8   rain a half inch up there in the land we're

           9   talking about.

          10          Q.    Well, and in the winter, it's

          11   typically drier; isn't it?

          12          A.    Normally.

          13          Q.    And in 2016, was that the case?

          14          A.    Well, that's what I'm trying to say.

          15   Without my books, I can't tell you how much it

          16   rained in '16.

          17          Q.    Okay.

          18          A.    But it doesn't matter how much rain.

          19   This place needs water today.  I could put my

          20   pump in and pump 50, 60 hours to bring the

          21   canal -- the water in the canals up to favorable

          22   height.

          23                Can I explain a little more?

          24          Q.    Go ahead.

          25          A.    The tribe put a plug in there.

                                                                   103




           1          Q.    But that was after 2016, wasn't it?

           2          A.    Yes.  So that was in '18 when they

           3   put the first one in, I think.

           4                But I've been all over that

           5   reservation my whole life and they never had no

           6   grass.  But since they put that plug in where

           7   they maintain their water, they got grass knee

           8   deep out there year round.  Bahia grass roots

           9   up -- that's all Argentine Bahia.  Root up to 30

          10   foot searching for water.

          11                If the water table is maintained at

          12   a certain level, you keep the roots going down

          13   there and they're feeding all the time.  But if

          14   the water table comes up high, the roots rot off.

          15   Water table goes out, now they got to start new

          16   roots.  So it's up and down.  You feed it one

          17   day, it's in a drought the next.  That's not a

          18   professional opinion, that's a professional

          19   opinion.

          20          Q.    So now, again, directing your

          21   attention to 2016, the time frame that gives rise

          22   to our claim?

          23          A.    What.

          24          Q.    The time frame that gives rise to

          25   why we're all here today.  Okay?

                                                                   104




           1          A.    Okay.

           2          Q.    Was there a time when you went to

           3   Jeanette Peeples or any of her people to ask

           4   about moving the boards in the double culverts?

           5          A.    Hadn't spoke to Jeanette since that

           6   youngin right there was about three years old and

           7   he's 40-something now.

           8          Q.    So you haven't spoken in a long

           9   time?

          10          A.    But I talked to her son, Billy.

          11          Q.    And what's his full name?

          12          A.    We always called him Little Billy

          13   Carlton.  I don't know.

          14          Q.    Billy Carlton is --

          15          A.    Yeah.

          16          Q.    And was he -- you understood him to

          17   be managing the property for her at that time?

          18          A.    I understood him to be on the

          19   property.  I don't know how much management he

          20   done.

          21          Q.    Okay.  But you understood that he

          22   was kind of running things for her?

          23          A.    Well, he was there.

          24          Q.    She wasn't ever out there, was she?

          25          A.    I've never seen there but one time.

                                                                   105




           1          Q.    Now, in 2016, were there occasions

           2   where you went to Billy Carlton and asked to have

           3   the boards removed?

           4          A.    Yes, sir.

           5          Q.    How many times?

           6          A.    Well, many times.  When he first

           7   started putting the double culverts in, him and

           8   John Austin was putting the culverts in.

           9          Q.    He, John Austin is who?

          10          A.    John Austin Collier.

          11                When they was putting the culverts

          12   in, me and Caleb pulled up there and he had a big

          13   track hoe -- a 283, 340, or something or another,

          14   big track hoe.  It requires about a three-yard

          15   bucket on it.  Poor little fella had him a little

          16   stump bucket about two foot wide that holds about

          17   a half a yard of dirt.  And so I walked around

          18   and questioned him why they brung him that track

          19   hoe to rent and he can't dig but two wheelbarrows

          20   full.

          21                And -- and I discussed with him and

          22   John Austin at that time about putting the

          23   culverts in.  My first question was why does each

          24   culvert got ten-foot risers on them.  Why do you

          25   need a ten-foot riser on a culvert.  A riser is

                                                                   106




           1   where the boards go down in.

           2                You want to go back, Judge?

           3                THE COURT:  No.

           4                THE WITNESS:  Why are you going to

           5          have a ten-footer.  It's impossible for a

           6          man to walk up there and pull the boards in

           7          and out of a ten-foot riser.  They was in

           8          there for 60 years with a five-foot riser

           9          on it.

          10   BY MR. ESPY:

          11          Q.    This is when they replaced the

          12   culverts in this 2016 --

          13          A.    In '16, yes, sir.  In March of '16.

          14   But with a five-foot riser, it's easy to manage

          15   the boards.

          16          Q.    What kind of answer did you get to

          17   that question about the ten-foot riser?

          18          A.    They're permitted that way.  They're

          19   supposed to be permitted that way.  And then I

          20   asked him if they was going to put boards in

          21   there if it's going to give him water.  And John

          22   Austin's exact comment to me --

          23                MR. JORGENSEN:  Objection, your

          24          Honor; hearsay.

          25                MR. ESPY:  It is.

                                                                   107




           1                THE COURT:  I agree.

           2                MR. ESPY:  You can't tell us what

           3          John Austin said.

           4                THE WITNESS:  Okay.

           5   BY MR. ESPY:

           6          Q.    But getting back to what I was

           7   asking you about before though?

           8                How many times in 2016 did you go to

           9   Billy Carlton and ask to have these boards

          10   removed so you could get some water?

          11          A.    Every time I saw him no matter where

          12   he was working, whether he was digging a bar pit,

          13   putting the culverts in, coming down the lane.  I

          14   begged all of them for water, except Jeanette.  I

          15   never spoke to her because she barred my number

          16   from her number from me calling her or whatever

          17   you call it.

          18          Q.    Y'all haven't spoken in a long time,

          19   I understand?

          20          A.    No, sir.

          21          Q.    But did Billy Carlton refuse every

          22   request you made then to raise those boards in

          23   2016?

          24          A.    Well, he didn't do it.

          25          Q.    When you spoke to him about it, he

                                                                   108




           1   just flat tell you to your face he wasn't going

           2   to do it?

           3          A.    No.  He said, I'll talked to Mama.

           4          Q.    But he never did it?

           5          A.    Never done it.

           6          Q.    And did the dry season get worse as

           7   the winter progressed?

           8          A.    Yes.

           9          Q.    Tell the Court sort of what happened

          10   to you as a consequence of the Defendants not

          11   removing these boards and you not being able to

          12   get sufficient water to irrigate your pasture

          13   lands in 2016, 2017?

          14          A.    And 2018 up until the Judge ruled

          15   that the boards had to come out the culverts.

          16                Well, your pasture land dries up.

          17   Your grass gets short.  Your cows get poor.  They

          18   don't produce very good.  Your calves don't gain.

          19   My calves average between 640 and 655 every

          20   year -- my steer calves.  And I sold calves that

          21   year that didn't weigh but 503 or four pounds.

          22          Q.    So they were malnourished.  Am I

          23   following you correct?

          24          A.    Well, if you don't eat no groceries,

          25   you get pretty poor.  We had to feed them.  I

                                                                   109




           1   never hauled a bale of hay to a cow in my life

           2   until '16.  And I haven't since because I got

           3   water.  Indians give me all the water I want.

           4   Anytime I want water, just go get it.

           5          Q.    So how long did this situation then

           6   continue?  It began in the dry season of 2016?

           7          A.    Until the Judge said the boards

           8   couldn't go back in there.

           9          Q.    And that was in 2018?

          10          A.    Latter part of '18.  He ruled on

          11   that I'm pretty sure.

          12          Q.    Okay.  Now, I want to talk to you

          13   about your damages as a result of your property

          14   being deprived of this water in the 2016, 2017

          15   time frame?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    And I asked you before we got here

          18   today to give some thought to that so you could

          19   explain; right?

          20          A.    Yes.

          21                MR. ESPY:  I want to show you what

          22          we mark as Plaintiff's 1 for

          23          identification.

          24   BY MR. ESPY:

          25          Q.    All right.  Mr. Pearce, I'm going to

                                                                   110




           1   hand you what we've marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit

           2   1 to identification?

           3                I believe you have seen that before;

           4   is that --

           5          A.    Yes, I have.

           6          Q.    Okay.  And explain to us -- did you

           7   help put this together?

           8          A.    No.  So this come from -- well, the

           9   first part of it is identifying the D.L. Pearce

          10   Ranch, Inc.'s permanent tag information.  I don't

          11   know why they named it that, but that's the

          12   cattle sales that I made at the time.  Me and

          13   Caleb prepared this.  That's my son sitting here

          14   with that bald head.

          15                We thought for court purposes, it

          16   was best to take an average of cattle prices from

          17   '14 until this was done in -- '14 -- '18, I guess

          18   it is so we could get an average price of what

          19   the cattle was bringing in the market.  And,

          20   then, the rest of it is my M & M Supply, vet

          21   bills, the hay was part of the damages that I

          22   bought from Glenn Harvey, Walpole Feed was part

          23   of it.  And I guess that's about all of it.

          24          Q.    All right.  You know --

          25          A.    Oh.  I had to -- I'd done the best I

                                                                   111




           1   could to get water by getting the artesian well

           2   blowed {sic} out.  And we found out that it was

           3   pumping salt, so we had to leave it capped off.

           4          Q.    Okay.  But the documentation there,

           5   that Composite Exhibit 1, was that documentation

           6   that was taken in consideration and used in order

           7   to come up with your damage amounts?

           8          A.    Yes.

           9                MR. ESPY:  We would offer

          10          Plaintiff's 1 for ID in evidence at this

          11          time.

          12                THE COURT:  You want --

          13                MR. ESPY:  Yes.

          14                MR. JORGENSEN:  Objection, your

          15          Honor.  Authenticity; hearsay.  A lot of

          16          records from different businesses.

          17                MR. ESPY:  I'm introducing this,

          18          your Honor, to help the Court understand

          19          the process Mr. Pearce --

          20                THE COURT:  We need to know what the

          21          source of those records and whether they're

          22          business records or what -- where they came

          23          from.

          24                THE WITNESS:  Those are bills.

                                                                   112




           1   BY MR. ESPY:

           2          Q.    Let me ask you some questions?

           3                Let's go through these, top to

           4   bottom, and just tell the Court what records are

           5   there and where they came from.

           6          A.    Okay.  Let's see.

           7                MR. ESPY:  I have an extra copy of

           8          this for the Court.

           9                THE COURT:  Hang on.  I don't want

          10          to -- I won't look at them, any details,

          11          until they're offered into evidence.

          12                MR. ESPY:  Yes, sir.

          13                THE WITNESS:  All right.  This first

          14          set of documents is showing sales made at

          15          the Okeechobee Livestock Market.

          16   BY MR. ESPY:

          17          Q.    Is that where you take -- or back at

          18   that time took --

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    -- a lot of your cows --

          21          A.    Yes.

          22                Then this B-3 Farms from Kelly

          23   Durks, that showed the price that I sold my

          24   steers, added to bamboos, which they had water

          25   there.

                                                                   113




           1                American Drilling, that's a bill

           2   that I received from blowing the wells out,

           3   trying to get more water out of them.  Ketchum

           4   Cracker Cattle Company, this is an invoice where

           5   they purchased these cattle from me showing the

           6   price of them?

           7          Q.    In what timeframe?

           8          A.    This was in September 27th of '17.

           9   You compare this with what the cattle was

          10   bringing at the Okeechobee Livestock Market.

          11   That's how we come up with our damage.

          12                Let's see.  Quick PCA, Quick Report.

          13   This is the PCA sales.  This is for Okeechobee

          14   Livestock Market.  That just shows that -- how

          15   many cattle you sold from June 13 to October 15.

          16                Superior Livestock, this is invoice

          17   showing where they bought my steer calves every

          18   year for the last four or five years I've been

          19   selling my calves private treaty through Tommy

          20   Mann, River Palmdale to Superior.  And that shows

          21   the cattle that I sold that year.

          22                This is a customer's item sold at WW

          23   Supply.  That is a supply where you buy all your

          24   medicines.  They even sell chlorine there, your

          25   worm medicine.

                                                                   114




           1          Q.    Did you have worming issues during

           2   this time?

           3          A.    Yes, sir.  When the grass got

           4   short -- when the grass is short, if it's below

           5   eight inches long, the worms crawl up it.  And as

           6   they eat the grass off when it's that short, it

           7   causes the worms to go into the cow's belly, and

           8   then they hatch off eggs every 21 days.

           9                So between the best practices,

          10   between 18 and 20 days after you worm them, you

          11   got to worm them again when you're on short

          12   grass.

          13          Q.    Okay.  And this was a problem during

          14   the 2016/2017 --

          15          A.    Yes, sir.  I had no grass.

          16                Let's see.  I guess this is starting

          17   in '14.  This is from Okeechobee Livestock Market

          18   showing sales of the cattle that are sold there.

          19          Q.    Through what period of time?

          20          A.    Well, I got them from '14 to -- I

          21   said it a while ago -- '14 to '18, I think it

          22   was.

          23                Yes.  The cattle sales goes all the

          24   way to January of '19.  You've got Walpole Feed &

          25   Supply.  That's -- Walpole is a feed company.

                                                                   115




           1   Everybody knows who Walpole is.

           2          Q.    Well -- and so the information from

           3   Walpole, how does that pertain to this case?  Is

           4   that money you spent there?

           5          A.    Yes.  That is an invoice of the

           6   money that I spent there at Walpole's.

           7                Now, if the question is going to

           8   come up --

           9          Q.    Well, let's finish with this

          10   exhibit?

          11          A.    Okay.

          12                MR. ESPY:  With that predicate, I

          13          would reoffer Exhibit 1 for identification,

          14          your Honor.

          15                MR. JORGENSEN:  Same objection as to

          16          authenticity.  None of these vendors are

          17          here to testify or state authenticity.

          18          Plus, there's a lot of stuff in here from

          19          2014, 2015, and those are not relevant to

          20          the damages that they are intending to --

          21                THE COURT:  I think they're being

          22          offered -- my understanding of the

          23          testimony, they're being offered for

          24          comparison purposes, showing what the

          25          difference in prices were that he got.

                                                                   116




           1                MR. JORGENSEN:  I understand that,

           2          but --

           3                THE COURT:  2014 and '15 and then

           4          the year in question -- years in question,

           5          which is 2016, 2017.

           6                MR. JORGENSEN:  I understand that,

           7          but he's also got supplies in here from

           8          2014 and supplies from 2015.

           9                THE COURT:  I'll ignore them.

          10          Unless they show that it was significantly

          11          impacted by 2016 and '17.

          12                I'm going to admit the exhibit

          13          subject to cross.

          14                (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1 was

          15          offered into evidence and received by the

          16          Court.)

          17   BY MR. ESPY:

          18          Q.    All right, Mr. Pearce.  I

          19   interrupted you.  Go ahead and finish the

          20   statement you were making?

          21          A.    And as far as the cattle sales, we

          22   got Jeff Bender subpoenaed.  You got to them.

          23          Q.    Okay.  Now, I want to cover -- I

          24   want to get to the numbers of your damages in a

          25   moment, but I want to cover the different

                                                                   117




           1   categories first that you took into

           2   consideration.  We've sort of done this, but I

           3   want to summarize them all at one point time?

           4                One is you've got alternate feed;

           5   right?  I think you said you --

           6          A.    You got what.

           7          Q.    Alternate feed?  You had to bring

           8   hay in.  You've never --

           9          A.    Okay.

          10          Q.    That's one category; right?

          11                You had to worm the cows more often.

          12                Is that another one?

          13          A.    Yes.  We had the labor.

          14          Q.    How much more labor?

          15          A.    Well, when you worm a cow every 21

          16   days, quite a bit of labor.

          17          Q.    Labor from whom?  How are the cows

          18   wormed?

          19          A.    Well, you got to hire crew to help

          20   you, four or five cowboys.  You go out there, you

          21   pay them $250 to run them back in, at $200 a

          22   head, per cowboy.  And you bring the cattle in,

          23   you put them in the pen, you run them down a

          24   hydraulic chute, you squeeze them up, stick the

          25   worm medicine in their mouth, and squirt it down

                                                                   118




           1   their throat.

           2          Q.    I don't think I've asked you and I

           3   meant to for the last 30 or 40 minutes.  But how

           4   many head of cattle did you have on the north

           5   side of the L-59 borrow canal back in 2016?

           6          A.    Probably 600 head.

           7                Now, let me ask this -- no

           8   disrespect, Judge, but do you know anything about

           9   cows?

          10                THE COURT:  Some.

          11                THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Am I supposed

          12          to -- if a man asks you how many cows you

          13          have, is that how many head of bovine you

          14          have, or how many mama cows you have?

          15                THE COURT:  Let your attorney ask

          16          you that question.

          17   BY MR. ESPY:

          18          Q.    All right.  And that is one of the

          19   things I wanted to ask you about, is that you had

          20   told me previously that the mama cows weren't

          21   giving birth --

          22          A.    When you ask a rancher how many cows

          23   he got, he ain't talking about baby calves,

          24   because cows don't have calves every year.  You

          25   might have some dry cows.  He talking about adult

                                                                   119




           1   cows.

           2                But with this bunch here, you don't

           3   know what they're talking about.  They talking

           4   about bovine -- I had a cow and a calf on

           5   almost -- a calf on almost every one of those 600

           6   head.

           7          Q.    Okay.  So that would move the number

           8   up?

           9          A.    I run a 92 percent calf crop.

          10          Q.    And that was before 2016; right?

          11          A.    Sir.

          12          Q.    That was before this problem

          13   happened in 2016?

          14          A.    What was before.

          15          Q.    The 92 percent.  Did it go down?

          16          A.    Oh, yeah.

          17          Q.    That's what I want to get to?

          18          A.    And my average on these prices are

          19   figuring them at an 80 percent calf crop.  And

          20   anybody that owns a cow and don't have a calf

          21   percentage that's better than 80 percent, he

          22   needs to get out of the cow business and start

          23   raising donkeys.

          24          Q.    Did you have more dry mama cows

          25   after this drought in 2016, 2017 than you --

                                                                   120




           1          A.    Yes.  When a cow gets starved down,

           2   it takes it at least three years for her to get

           3   back to 95 percent or better.

           4          Q.    At least three years after going

           5   through this period --

           6          A.    Yes, sir.

           7          Q.    -- of malnourishment?

           8          A.    That's correct.

           9          Q.    Okay.  And that's been calculated

          10   into your damage calculator?

          11          A.    That's history.

          12          Q.    Okay.  Did you have to sell calves

          13   because of this drought in 2016, 2017 that you --

          14          A.    Yes, sir.

          15          Q.    -- would not have sold otherwise?

          16          A.    Yes, sir.  I sold quite a few

          17   cattle.  And the way me and the boys looked at

          18   it, we had producing cattle on the other part of

          19   the ranch.  But we had two-year-old heifers

          20   that's not going to give you a calf for another

          21   year, year and a half.  And the first calf out of

          22   the heifer is sorry.  That's what you call a

          23   knot.  He ain't worth very much money.  So we

          24   chose to sell these heifers instead of our adult

          25   producing cow that's producing a 650-pound calf.

                                                                   121




           1                So in my calculation, I think that I

           2   should be paid for the calves that would have

           3   been produced out of those heifers, those

           4   two-year-old heifers at an 80 percent calf crop

           5   for the next ten years.

           6                We sell our cows at twelve years old

           7   unless something happens to her, you know.  But

           8   the average age of a cow -- my cousin, John

           9   Austin Collier, got some cows at 15, 16 years

          10   old.  They still having calves.

          11          Q.    And you're basing that number that

          12   you just gave and that estimate that you just

          13   gave on your long history raising cows on that

          14   very property?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    So when we add all these categories

          17   together, have you arrived at a dollar figure

          18   that you think fairly and accurately represents

          19   the damages you sustained as a result of the

          20   Defendant's failure to remove the boards in 2016,

          21   causing these severe problems to your pasture

          22   lands and to your cows?

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    And what is that figure?

          25          A.    Above $800,000.

                                                                   122




           1                MR. ESPY:  Can I have just a moment,

           2          your Honor?

           3                THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

           4                (There is a pause in the testimony.)

           5                MR. ESPY:  I do have one brief line

           6          of questioning, if you would?

           7                THE COURT:  Go ahead.

           8                MR. ESPY:  Let me see the exhibits

           9          for just a minute.  I want to ask him

          10          something about...

          11   BY MR. ESPY:

          12          Q.    Mr. Pearce, let me hand you what is

          13   marked as Exhibit 4 and that is Plaintiff's

          14   Exhibit 4 in evidence.  This is a permit you had

          15   in effect, is it not, at the time in 2016?

          16          A.    Yes.  This is a permit that I got in

          17   June of '16.

          18          Q.    Okay.  And what is the location that

          19   that permit, in your mind, applies to?  And point

          20   out the portions of the permit that you're

          21   referring to?

          22          A.    Well, we've got to go to the --

          23                MR. JORGENSEN:  Objection, your

          24          Honor.  "In your mind" is just speculation.

          25                THE COURT:  Yeah.  The permit says

                                                                   123




           1          it's a permit --

           2                MR. ESPY:  I realize that's a

           3          poorly-phrased question.  Can I stand by

           4          the witness, your Honor, to speed this up?

           5   BY MR. ESPY:

           6          Q.    Mr. Pearce, let me look at this for

           7   a second.  And I can shorten this?

           8          A.    Yeah.  But here's what you want to

           9   see right here, ain't it, the project

          10   description.

          11          Q.    Yes, that is?

          12          A.    Okay.  Everything on the first page.

          13                The Staff Report, your Honor.  Like

          14   I told you before, my permit that was up at that

          15   Ox Farm on Paradise Run was for 950 acres.  This

          16   permit, even though it has the same permit

          17   number, there was no reason to go through all the

          18   hydrology and all that stuff in order to amend

          19   this permit.  That's what we done was amended it.

          20                We went from 950 acres to 387.6

          21   acres.  We went from a 12-inch 80 horse power

          22   pump -- no.  Well, close enough -- to an 18-inch

          23   80 horse power portable pump that pumps 10,000

          24   gallons a minute at 1200 RPMs.  This permit says

          25   "on site ditches and canals."

                                                                   124




           1                Aero photos that showed there's no

           2   onsite ditches or canals at Paradise Run.  That

           3   pump is back right down into Paradise Run.

           4   There's no on site ditch there.

           5                The project description:

           6                     "D.L. Pearce Ranch

           7                Project" is an existing

           8                cattle ranch which will

           9                utilize surface water from

          10                an onsite canal to provide

          11                irrigation to 387.6 acres

          12                of pasture using seepage

          13                for -- slash, "for

          14                irrigation system."

          15                Tomato farms.  Lots of cross-ditches

          16   in there, every 100 yards.

          17                As read:

          18                     "The project is located

          19                adjacent to the L-59 Canal

          20                and one mile west of C-38

          21                Canal."

          22                "Adjacent" can mean -- me and you is

          23   not setting adjacent even though we decide it

          24   because there's a barrier in here.  If this was

          25   open and used way down yonder red light, you'd

                                                                   125




           1   still be adjacent to me, according to --

           2          Q.    Well, Paradise Run is not adjacent

           3   to the L-59 Canal and one mile west of the C-38,

           4   is it?

           5          A.    It's connected to the L-59 Canal.

           6          Q.    But it's not -- and it's not --

           7          A.    No, it ain't adjacent.

           8          Q.    And it's not one mile west either,

           9   is it?

          10          A.    What.

          11          Q.    Paradise Run?

          12          A.    No.  Paradise Run is three, 400

          13   yards from C-38.

          14          Q.    And the stub canal that we talked

          15   about much of the morning, that is about -- you

          16   testified that's about one mile west of C-38, and

          17   it's adjacent --

          18          A.    It's a little over one mile.

          19          Q.    And it is adjacent to the L-59?

          20          A.    It's right -- yes, sir.  It's

          21   connect to it, yes, sir.  Right of it.

          22          Q.    And that was your understanding when

          23   you obtained this permit, what it applied to?

          24          A.    Absolutely.

          25                The reason they give me this permit,

                                                                   126




           1   was to go --

           2                MR. JORGENSEN:  Objection, your

           3          Honor.  There's no question asked.  He's

           4          just talking.

           5                THE COURT:  He was giving an answer.

           6                MR. ESPY:  Go ahead and explain your

           7          answer.

           8                THE COURT:  Go ahead, sir.

           9                THE WITNESS:  The purpose of this --

          10          the reason there was no problem getting

          11          this permit because it's the same water

          12          going on the same land, and it's seeping

          13          back in the same canal.  So it was no

          14          reason to deny.

          15   BY MR. ESPY:

          16          Q.    Are you aware of discrepancies in

          17   that permit itself, in the terms of it?  It does

          18   reference Paradise Run; you're aware of that --

          19          A.    That's the history.  That's the

          20   history.  Like I told you, we didn't need to

          21   change the history.  It's the same land and

          22   everything.  But we did amend it and change it by

          23   pumping from Paradise Run to what you-all named

          24   the stub canal.  But that's what's confused

          25   everybody.

                                                                   127




           1                I spent hours with the flood control

           2   with that man sitting right back there.

           3          Q.    You're pointing at Mr. Chesser?

           4          A.    Bruce Chesser.  Took me three hours

           5   and 20 minutes to convince that man that my

           6   permit said that I could pump out that stub

           7   canal.

           8                MR. ESPY:  That's all I have.

           9                THE COURT:  All right.  We're going

          10          to break for lunch.

          11                You can step down, sir.

          12                THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir.

          13                (The witness stepped down from the

          14          stand.)

          15                THE COURT:  We'll break until 1:15.

          16                MR. ESPY:  Thank you, your Honor.

          17                THE BAILIFF:  All rise.  Court's in

          18          recess.

          19                (Whereupon, a luncheon recess was

          20          taken from 12:00 p.m. until 1:26 p.m.)

          21                THE COURT:  The witness will retake

          22          the stand.

          23                Cross.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  Thank you, Judge.

           1                    CROSS-EXAMINATION

           2   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           3          Q.    Good afternoon, Mr. Pearce.

           4          A.    Good afternoon.

           5          Q.    Has Pearce Ranch ever applied for a

           6   permit to draw water out of the L-59 canal east

           7   of the double culverts?

           8          A.    Not that I know of.

           9          Q.    Okay.  Did Pearce Ranch have the

          10   opportunity to apply for a permit during that

          11   two-year window of opportunity to do so?

          12          A.    No, sir; because there's an

          13   allocation of water on the L-59 canal.  And John

          14   Austin and Myron and Jeannette took up the last

          15   of the allocations.

          16          Q.    Those are in later years.  I'm

          17   talking about after the 1972 Water Resources Act

          18   was first enacted.

          19                Did Pearce Ranch attempt to get a

          20   permit to draw water from --

          21          A.    Not that I know of.

          22          Q.    Did anything prevent Pearce Ranch

          23   from doing that?

          24          A.    Well, the main reason, we didn't

          25   need a permit because didn't need no water.  The

                                                                   129




           1   boards were out of the culvert and culvert risers

           2   were --

           3          Q.    You mentioned in your direct

           4   examination that the stub canal has been there

           5   since '57.  Is that what I heard your testimony

           6   to be?

           7          A.    That's correct.

           8          Q.    And how do you know that?

           9          A.    I got aerial photos to prove it.

          10          Q.    Okay.  Where does the -- before the

          11   L-59 was constructed, where did water for the

          12   stub canal come from?

          13          A.    Before the L-59 was constructed.

          14          Q.    Yes, sir?

          15          A.    Where did the water come from.

          16          Q.    For the stub canal?

          17          A.    There wasn't no stub canal.  As I

          18   showed you, there was -- the canal -- what's left

          19   of the canal is what y'all mean the stub was

          20   originally put in to go around the tomater

          21   grade -- the tomater farm.

          22          Q.    Okay.  Whatever that was, where did

          23   the water come from?

          24                As I understand your testimony,

          25   there was a body of water that we've been calling

                                                                   130




           1   the stub canal.  And I understood you to say that

           2   it existed prior to the construction of the

           3   L-59 --

           4          A.    The canal did, yes.

           5          Q.    Where does the --

           6          A.    The word "stub" is something you two

           7   gentlemen, you and Mr. Glass, come up with.

           8          Q.    No, I think -- I think your counsel

           9   did but nevertheless?

          10          A.    Okay.  Anyhow, the stub canal became

          11   a stub canal when Daddy put his pump in there.

          12          Q.    And what year was this?

          13          A.    '65, '66, somewhere in '67.  But you

          14   had to put a dyke across -- 150 yards up there in

          15   order to set your pump up because it was a

          16   stationary pump.  It sat in the middle of the

          17   canal.

          18          Q.    Does Pearce Ranch have a permit to

          19   draw water from the stub canal?

          20          A.    Yes, we do.  You got it right there

          21   on your desk.

          22          Q.    This would be Permit 22-00127?

          23          A.    Let me see it.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  If I may approach,

          25          your Honor.

                                                                   131




           1                THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

           2   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           3          Q.    Is the word "stub canal" anywhere in

           4   that permit?

           5          A.    The word "stub canal" is not in this

           6   permit because that's something you come up

           7   October the 4th, as far as I'm concerned.  It

           8   says -- just a moment, your Honor.  I'll turn it

           9   to the page you need.

          10                It says the project description is

          11   at an on-site canal.  If you go north of the L-59

          12   any place, that's the only canal that's on-site.

          13   So there's your answer, I guess.

          14          Q.    And your permit -- the permit though

          15   requires you to draw water from a pump, does it

          16   not, at Paradise Run?

          17          A.    The what.

          18                MR. JORGENSEN:  The permit.

          19                If I may approach again, your Honor.

          20                THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

          21   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          22          Q.    The permit talks about a water pump

          23   that is situated at Paradise Run?

          24          A.    That's the history of it.  Yes, sir.

          25          Q.    Well, that's not the history.  It's

                                                                   132




           1   right in the permit, isn't it?

           2          A.    No, sir.

           3          Q.    Are you familiar with the diagram

           4   that's --

           5          A.    Absolutely.

           6          Q.    All right?

           7          A.    That's the history.  That was the

           8   history that come --

           9          Q.    Where is the pump now?

          10                Is there a pump on-site that's

          11   governed by this permit?

          12          A.    No, sir.  It's sitting under my

          13   barn.

          14          Q.    Okay.  And, in fact -- so there's no

          15   pump at the stub canal now either; is that

          16   correct?

          17          A.    It's a portable pump.  You drag it

          18   up there and put it in the canal.

          19          Q.    But right now it's in your garden?

          20          A.    It's right outside -- yes, sir --

          21   under an oak tree.  I just told you -- the Judge

          22   that I took it out and painted it for him.

          23          Q.    And when's the last time you used

          24   that pump?

          25          A.    Let me think just a minute.

                                                                   133




           1                THE COURT:  You're talking in the

           2          stub canal?

           3                MR. JORGENSEN:  I'm just talking

           4          in -- I'm just talking in general.

           5                THE COURT:  You're just talking,

           6          period.  Okay.

           7                MR. JORGENSEN:  I'm just talking in

           8          general.

           9                THE COURT:  Understood.

          10   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          11          Q.    When's the last time you used it?

          12          A.    This is October.  I run that pump

          13   195 hours in May, in June.  I went to the beach

          14   to -- end of April, all of May, and the first

          15   week of June.  Yeah.  We went to the beach the

          16   last week in June, the last Saturday in June I

          17   think.

          18          Q.    And that's this year?

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    And where did you run it?

          21          A.    In the stub canal, as y'all call it.

          22          Q.    And you think you have a permit to

          23   run a pump in the stub canal based on this

          24   particular permit --

          25          A.    Yes.

                                                                   134




           1          Q.    -- 00127-W?

           2          A.    Yes, I do.

           3          Q.    And this requires -- this permit

           4   allows you a certain allocation, doesn't it?

           5          A.    Not if the flood control don't

           6   consider me having a permit, it doesn't.  I took

           7   John Hixen there and showed him the pump running

           8   and he says it can't be there.  I said I'm going

           9   to run it until I get all the water I want.  Now

          10   in the past, they charged me $1,000 a day when I

          11   do something wrong.  Nobody there said a word

          12   about me running that pump and it's been there

          13   for over two years.

          14          Q.    There's an allocation provided for

          15   in the permit of --

          16          A.    I know that.

          17          Q.    -- 70.51 million gallons per month?

          18          A.    I know that.

          19          Q.    Have you -- have you kept track of

          20   the water that you've used -- you know, that

          21   you've alleged used under this permit?

          22          A.    There's no allegedly to it.  I told

          23   you I run 195 hours --

          24          Q.    Have you --

          25          A.    -- pumping at 8,500 gallons a

                                                                   135




           1   minute.

           2          Q.    And have you submitted those records

           3   to the District?

           4          A.    Don't need to.  They don't -- they

           5   don't exist.  There's no place to submit the

           6   records.

           7          Q.    You did run records though, did you

           8   not though, on the pump that was at Paradise Run?

           9          A.    There was no water to pump at

          10   Paradise Run.

          11          Q.    You calibrated it one time, didn't

          12   you?

          13          A.    Well, they can calibrate the pump

          14   sitting at the house.

          15          Q.    So this permit was issued in June

          16   2016, correct -- June 20th, I'm sorry?

          17          A.    That's correct.

          18          Q.    All right.  And so before that date

          19   under this permit, you didn't have any right to

          20   draw any water from Paradise Run?

          21          A.    Did I have a right to draw water

          22   from Paradise Run in June of 2016.

          23          Q.    Prior to June 20, 2016?

          24          A.    Prior to that, yes.

          25          Q.    How so?

                                                                   136




           1          A.    I had a permit for up there.

           2          Q.    Well, the --

           3          A.    And I amended the permit.

           4          Q.    But it expired though --

           5          A.    Oh, I don't know about expired.

           6          Q.    Well, it had expired?

           7          A.    I'll take your word for it.

           8          Q.    All right.  You know when it expired

           9   or you just don't know that at all?

          10          A.    I just told you I don't know.

          11                MR. JORGENSEN:  One moment, your

          12          Honor.

          13   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          14          Q.    Well, assuming that it had

          15   expired -- and it's looks like the permit was

          16   originally issued in 1987.  And according to this

          17   statutory, it requires you to bring it to -- it

          18   expired in February 2009?

          19          A.    I'll take your word --

          20                MR. ESPY:  I object to the question.

          21          I think he's asking a hypothetical.  You

          22          said assuming it had expired.  I think

          23          that's an improper predicate.

          24                THE COURT:  It's my understanding

          25          that he's telling him from a report when

                                                                   137




           1          the pump was expired.

           2                MR. JORGENSEN:  I am.

           3                THE COURT:  When the permit expired,

           4          not the pump.  When the permit expired.

           5   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           6          Q.    According to the statutory attached

           7   to the permit, the permit expired in February

           8   2009?

           9          A.    If that's what you say.

          10          Q.    That's what the permit says?

          11          A.    Let me see it.

          12          Q.    I'm glad to.  I apologize.  I

          13   circled it but it's up here?

          14          A.    That's all right.

          15                THE COURT:  Are we referring to a

          16          document that's been introduced?

          17                MR. JORGENSEN:  Yes, it is in

          18          evidence.

          19                (Simultaneously speaking.)

          20                THE COURT:  Four?

          21                MR. JORGENSEN:  Four.

          22                THE COURT:  I just want to make

          23          sure.

          24                THE WITNESS:  Can I speak about this

          25          permit history?

                                                                   138




           1                MR. JORGENSEN:  No.  I just want to

           2          ask you -- you wanted to see the permit and

           3          I've shown it to you.

           4                THE COURT:  What page are you

           5          referring to?

           6                THE WITNESS:  What page?  Page --

           7                MR. JORGENSEN:  Page 2 of 11 of the

           8          statutory.

           9                THE COURT:  Page 2 of 11.  Okay.

          10          Second part of the report.

          11                THE WITNESS:  It's called the permit

          12          history.

          13   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          14          Q.    But you wanted to see the permit,

          15   Mr. Pearce.  I've shown it to you?

          16                Do you see where it states that the

          17   permit expired in February 2009?

          18          A.    Yeah, I see it.

          19          Q.    And then you noted also on Page 1 of

          20   the permit that the permit was, you know, made

          21   active again, for lack of a better word, in June

          22   20, 2016; is that correct?

          23          A.    It was amended and reissued in June

          24   of '16.

          25          Q.    And did you apply to have it

                                                                   139




           1   reissued?

           2          A.    Yes, I did.  The first one.

           3          Q.    And you did so on behalf of Pearce

           4   Ranch; correct?

           5          A.    That's who the permit name is.

           6          Q.    Okay.  And so would you agree with

           7   me then from February 2009 through June 20, 2016,

           8   Pearce Ranch did not have a permit to draw water

           9   from Paradise Run?

          10          A.    If my permit was expired, yes.

          11          Q.    And would you agree that it didn't

          12   have a permit under this particular permit,

          13   Exhibit Number 4, to draw water from the stub

          14   canal?

          15                MR. ESPY:  Objection, argumentative.

          16          It's been asked and answered.

          17                THE COURT:  Overruled.

          18                You may respond, sir.

          19                THE WITNESS:  When -- what time

          20          frame are we talking about?

          21   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          22          Q.    Did Pearce Ranch have a permit to

          23   draw water from the stub canal from February of

          24   2009 until June 20, 2016?

          25          A.    No.

                                                                   140




           1          Q.    And the dry period that you're

           2   talking about that started in the winter of 2016.

           3   Is that my understanding?

           4          A.    It started in March of '16 when they

           5   cut the water off with the boards.

           6          Q.    And continued for how long -- until

           7   2018?

           8          A.    When the Judge ruled that we take

           9   the boards out.

          10          Q.    And what happened to the stub canal

          11   when the boards were placed in the double

          12   culverts in 2016?

          13          A.    It dried up.  Play marbles at the

          14   bottom of it.

          15          Q.    And is that the only water source

          16   you're relying on in your 380-something acres --

          17   the stub canal?

          18          A.    That is correct.

          19          Q.    You don't reply on --

          20          A.    No, hold up just now.  I take that

          21   back.  There's an artesian well on the west side

          22   of that 386 acres that Jeanette had been close --

          23   shutting it off.  It flows under the fence to my

          24   cattle.  Water about 25,300 head of cattle there.

          25   I had dug two large bar pits adjacent to that

                                                                   141




           1   artesian well that had been there since '49.  And

           2   they went over there and cut it off and stopped

           3   my water from -- my cattle from getting water

           4   from there.

           5          Q.    Any other sources of water?

           6          A.    No.

           7          Q.    How much do you rely on rainfall?

           8          A.    Up there, very little.

           9          Q.    In the summertime, you don't get a

          10   lot of --

          11          A.    Very little.

          12          Q.    What's your average rainfall up

          13   there?

          14          A.    Approximately eight inches a year.

          15          Q.    Eight inches a year?

          16          A.    Yes, sir.

          17          Q.    In Glades County in 16 -- in

          18   Sections 9 and 16, eight inches a year?

          19          A.    Yes, sir.

          20          Q.    You measure that?

          21          A.    Yes, sir.  I got books to prove

          22   every -- even me and Flood Control even compared

          23   our books.  In about three years, I'm about a

          24   half inch off.  But, Mr. Jorgensen, you've got

          25   understand to answer your question, it can rain

                                                                   142




           1   on side of the barb wire fence and not on the

           2   other side.

           3          Q.    I understand that?

           4          A.    Well, that's the way it is out

           5   there.  Nobody believes that but I proved to

           6   Flood Control.

           7          Q.    I've lived in Florida all my life.

           8   I'm aware?

           9          A.    Okay.

          10          Q.    I'm not aware of any place in

          11   Florida that gets six to eight inches of rain a

          12   year though?

          13          A.    I might be off an inch or two but

          14   not very much.

          15          Q.    All right.  So you talked in your

          16   direct testimony about how the culverts were

          17   rusted out around 1981; is that correct?

          18          A.    That's correct.

          19          Q.    And the District put in an earthen

          20   plug in the canal?

          21          A.    No, sir.

          22          Q.    They never did that?

          23          A.    They put a plug in so they could

          24   drive the track from one side of the -- from the

          25   south side of the dyke over to the north side of

                                                                   143




           1   the dyke and clean the canal so they could put

           2   the dirt on that side -- on the north side of the

           3   canal.  They didn't have a long stick when they

           4   put that earthen plug in.

           5          Q.    But it was in the canal; correct?

           6          A.    But it didn't interfere with the

           7   water.  That was there for weeks.

           8          Q.    When was that?

           9          A.    You just named the dates.

          10          Q.    In the 80s.  Is that what you're

          11   talking about?

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    Okay.  So your testimony is there

          14   was not an earthen plug there put in by the

          15   District that was there for several years --

          16          A.    No.

          17          Q.    -- to stage water when the double

          18   culverts rusted out?

          19          A.    No.  That was a maintenance plug

          20   they called it.

          21          Q.    And you're aware of the tribe's

          22   water structure; correct?

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    And the first -- did -- the first

          25   one was an earthen plug, wasn't it, or was it a

                                                                   144




           1   more permanent structure -- the first one that

           2   the tribe put it?

           3          A.    Same as it is today.  Nothing's

           4   changed.

           5          Q.    Was there a culvert in the original

           6   plug that the tribe --

           7          A.    Yes, there was.

           8          Q.    And has the tribe plug affected your

           9   ability to get water downstream?

          10          A.    It did until I asked the tribe to

          11   come out and ride with me and let them see with

          12   their own eyes what was happening.  And we --

          13   when we got back, Eric Johns asked me -- he says,

          14   how come nobody showed me this before.  I said

          15   because who's been telling you is lying to you.

          16   I'll take you out there and you make up your own

          17   mind.  And he says you need water.  And since

          18   that day, I've had no problem with water.

          19          Q.    How long didn't you have water

          20   because of the tribe plug?

          21          A.    Probably 90 days.  Not very long.

          22          Q.    And what year was that?

          23          A.    Well, the Judge made them take the

          24   boards out of the double culverts in '18, 2018 I

          25   think.  But the tribe had their boards in.

                                                                   145




           1          Q.    After; correct?

           2          A.    Sir?  Yes.  Yes.

           3                Billy come to me and told me I

           4   didn't need to worry about the double culverts

           5   because the tribe was going to put their own

           6   culvert in down there.  And I would have to go to

           7   the supreme court to get anything done.  When St.

           8   Thomas was bought by the Seminole tribe, it's 300

           9   yards -- their property line is 300 yards east of

          10   Two Sisters culverts, which is owned by

          11   Juanelle -- Jeanette, Byron, and John

          12   Austin Collier -- Byron Storey, Jeanette Peeples.

          13                They was hoping that that plug you

          14   call it of the tribe would go in east of their

          15   culverts.  That would cut my water off but they

          16   get all the water.  They didn't understand that

          17   the tribe is a sovereign nation and had to put

          18   the plug in their property --

          19          Q.    Let's talk about your --

          20          A.    -- which cut their own water off.

          21          Q.    Let's talk about your damages,

          22   Mr. Pearce.  This is your Composite Exhibit 1.

          23          A.    Uh-huh.

          24          Q.    Which you put together; correct?

          25          A.    No, I didn't do that.

                                                                   146




           1          Q.    Well --

           2          A.    I ain't got sense enough to do

           3   nothing like that.

           4          Q.    The information --

           5          A.    I went to the -- went to the people

           6   that -- the companies, the Okeechobee Livestock

           7   Market, Walpole, W and W -- and told them to give

           8   me my bills and what I bought, my records, for X

           9   amount of time back.  And that's where that comes

          10   from.

          11          Q.    All right.  So your damages started

          12   in 2016; is that correct?

          13          A.    Not on January 1st it didn't.

          14          Q.    But sometime during 2016?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    All right.  So let's take a look at

          17   a few things in here?

          18                First of all, you've got some

          19   information -- some documents from W and W Supply

          20   Co. Inc. --

          21          A.    Correct.

          22          Q.    -- are you familiar with that

          23   company?

          24                And it's got in here posting date

          25   January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.  And

                                                                   147




           1   you got a total of $24,140.90.

           2          A.    Well, we going to take that amount,

           3   Mr. Jorgensen --

           4          Q.    Well -- -

           5          A.    If it says '14 on this --

           6          Q.    Why is it in there in the first

           7   place?

           8          A.    Because I asked them for everything

           9   that I ever bought from them, I guess.  I think

          10   what that's -- what's that doing is I averaged my

          11   price of my cattle from '14 until '18.  And

          12   that's why that might have come up right there.

          13          Q.    I get that.  These are expenses?

          14          A.    We going to it -- if it's not got

          15   something to do with '16, '17, '18, we'll take it

          16   out.

          17          Q.    All right.  So this $24,140.90, that

          18   comes out?

          19          A.    Yeah.

          20          Q.    And here's another one also from W

          21   and W Supply Co. Inc., January 1, 2015 to

          22   December 31, 2015.  The total is $33,313.89.

          23   That shouldn't be in there either, should it?

          24          A.    If it was in '14, no, sir.

          25          Q.    Did you look at those before it

                                                                   148




           1   was --

           2          A.    No, I didn't.

           3          Q.    -- put together?

           4                Should you have?

           5          A.    I don't know.

           6          Q.    Let's go over to Walpole?

           7                You got a big circle here.  Is that

           8   your writing -- 2014 circled?

           9          A.    No.

          10          Q.    This is --

          11          A.    That's '19.

          12          Q.    Well, this says 2014 here?

          13                And what are these dates here on all

          14   these...

          15          A.    All right.

          16          Q.    So --

          17          A.    Hold up.  I got my hand under it.

          18                All right.  Anything that's not

          19   during the time period we've been discussed

          20   here except -- hold on just a minute.  I heard

          21   that youngin squealing over yonder and I

          22   remember.  You've got to take into consideration

          23   that this is a -- who is this W -- this is

          24   Walpole.  This is our medicine that we get our

          25   worm medicine from.

                                                                   149




           1                And when we buy worm medicine, we

           2   don't by one jug at a time.  We buy cases.  And

           3   we work our cattle in December for two weeks.  We

           4   work our cattle in March for two weeks.  We work

           5   out cattle in June or July for two weeks and so

           6   on and so on.  Every year is the same thing.  So

           7   that's why these medicines are here in the latter

           8   part of --

           9          Q.    2014?

          10                MR. ESPY:  Well, he needs to let the

          11          witness finish.

          12                THE WITNESS:  I'm looking at '15.

          13                MR. JORGENSEN:  Well, we were

          14          focused on 2014.  Let's discuss that first.

          15                MR. ESPY:  Your Honor, I think the

          16          witness is still answering the last

          17          question.  I'd ask that he'd be allowed to

          18          finish.

          19                THE COURT:  Let him finish and we'll

          20          move on from there.

          21                THE WITNESS:  Well, I'll go back to

          22          '14, your Honor, if I can.

          23                You can't be charged -- I can't put

          24          no damages in for something that happened

          25          before the fact.  I agree with you.

                                                                   150




           1   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           2          Q.    All right.  I appreciate that?

           3                And the total amount of those

           4   Walpole damages for -- or amounts for 2014 --

           5          A.    W and W, not Walpole.

           6          Q.    I thought we were talking about

           7   Walpole.  I lost my spot?

           8                There we go.  2014, Walpole.

           9          A.    No.  Common sense will tell you we

          10   can't charge you for that.

          11          Q.    Okay.  Well, I get that but it's in

          12   your Composite Exhibit here that you --

          13          A.    Well --

          14          Q.    -- to prove damages?

          15          A.    -- me or somebody made a mistake.

          16          Q.    Well, let's get the total --

          17   $47,667.24?

          18          A.    If it was in the year of '14, that's

          19   correct.

          20          Q.    And is it, isn't it?  You can take

          21   a look if you like?

          22          A.    Yes, sir.  Yeah, I see it.

          23          Q.    All right.  So that should come out

          24   of your computation of damages; correct?

          25          A.    Yes, sir.

                                                                   151




           1          Q.    You got Walpole 2015.  Let me just

           2   go to the total.  I see the total at $63,238.44.

           3   This is for Walpole expenses from January 2, 2015

           4   through December 30, 2015.

           5                Would you agree with me that these

           6   damage should not be included in the claim that

           7   you're making?

           8          A.    There's no way that I can say that

           9   you should be charged for anything that happened

          10   before January or March of '16.

          11          Q.    So how many head of cattle did you

          12   have on your -- in your pasture lands -- is it 16

          13   and -- what is it, 9 and 16?

          14          A.    That's correct.

          15          Q.    Okay.  How many head of cattle did

          16   you have?

          17          A.    Hold on.  He asked it, Judge.

          18                THE COURT:  I guess you need to find

          19          out how you want him to count the cattle.

          20                MR. JORGENSEN:  I'd count them cow

          21          by cow or cattle -- whatever they are.

          22                THE WITNESS:  Are you asking about

          23          today?

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  No, 2016.

          25                THE WITNESS:  I had 347 head of

                                                                   152




           1          heifers and I had -- I think there was 212

           2          or 15 head of -- no, I got to double that.

           3          212 times two is 414.  Add those two

           4          numbers together, that'll tell you what I

           5          had north of L-59.

           6                THE COURT:  424 but that's okay.

           7          I'm not good at math either but I can do

           8          that one.

           9                MR. JORGENSEN:  So 424.

          10                THE WITNESS:  212 times two is 424.

          11                MR. JORGENSEN:  424 -- I missed.

          12                THE WITNESS:  212 and 212 is 424.

          13                MR. JORGENSEN:  Right.  So you

          14          had --

          15                THE WITNESS:  And I had 318 -- get

          16          her to read it back.  I think I had 318 but

          17          I ain't sure.  I'll say 318.

          18   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          19          Q.    318 of what?

          20          A.    Those was heifers.

          21          Q.    Okay.  Not 347, it was 318?

          22          A.    Okay.

          23          Q.    And the 424 were what?

          24          A.    Cows.  Cattle.  You said how many

          25   head of cattle.  That was -- them heads.  They

                                                                   153




           1   don't have two at a time.  I've only seen one in

           2   my life.

           3          Q.    So you're seeking damages over

           4   800,000; correct?

           5          A.    That's what I said.

           6          Q.    All right.  So walk me through how

           7   you arrived at that figure?

           8          A.    Again.  All right.  If I had to sell

           9   a two-year-old cow, how many calves would that

          10   two-year-old cow produce in her lifetime.

          11   Average them at ten years old when you sell them.

          12   She has her first calf when she's three and she

          13   has a calf every year after that at a 80 percent

          14   calf crop.  Follow me.

          15          Q.    I got you?

          16          A.    Okay.  What was those calves worth

          17   that would have been born in that period of time

          18   and average them at $700 or $750 a head.  Now,

          19   that's taking an average from Okeechobee

          20   Livestock Market there for a five-year-period, I

          21   think it is.

          22          Q.    So tell me the math.  How does it

          23   work?  Have you done that computation?

          24          A.    No, I haven't.

          25          Q.    And how --

                                                                   154




           1          A.    And I don't have it in front of me.

           2   I have done it but I don't have it in front of

           3   me.

           4          Q.    Do you have it anywhere here today

           5   that we can look at?

           6          A.    No, sir, I don't.  I'm sorry.

           7          Q.    You're saying it's more than

           8   $800,000, you don't have the calculation with

           9   you.  And did you do it just based on this -- on,

          10   you know, you had to sell a cow at two years as

          11   opposed to ten years?  Is that how you did your

          12   damages and then the loss of a calf for each year

          13   for Years Three through Ten?

          14          A.    That's part of it.  Yes, sir.

          15          Q.    Okay.  What else?

          16          A.    I think punitive damages has got a

          17   lot to do with it and that ain't even been

          18   mentioned.

          19          Q.    Well, it's not pled so we're not

          20   talking about punitive damages?

          21          A.    Okay.  Well, I got my lawyer fees in

          22   there.  You don't want to forgot about them.  You

          23   lawyers like to be paid.

          24          Q.    I'm not interested in attorney fees

          25   at the moment.  I'm interested in what your

                                                                   155




           1   damages are.  You said, you know, more than

           2   $800,000.  We've talked about, you know, having

           3   to sell your cows early so they couldn't have

           4   calves for Years Three through Ten?

           5                Did you replace those calves though?

           6   Didn't you buy new ones?

           7          A.    I don't buy cows.

           8          Q.    I mean, didn't you buy new cows?

           9          A.    I don't buy cows.

          10          Q.    Okay?

          11          A.    A good rancher don't buy cows.

          12   Nobody does.

          13          Q.    So you sold your young cows -- when

          14   does a calf become a cow?

          15          A.    When does a calf become a cow?  Just

          16   like a woman.  When she has her first baby, she

          17   becomes a woman.

          18          Q.    And for these cows that you told

          19   early at Year Two, you didn't replace any of

          20   them?

          21          A.    Ask me again.

          22          Q.    Did you replace any of the cows that

          23   you sold earlier -- you sold them when they were

          24   two years old?

          25          A.    Yes, I replaced them.

                                                                   156




           1          Q.    Just through reproduction on the

           2   pasture or did you buy cows?

           3          A.    No, I don't buy cows.  Every year a

           4   rancher takes out his best heifers at nine or ten

           5   months old when you take them off their mama.

           6   You keep the best ones for replacement heifers.

           7   That's what they're called.  You're replacing.

           8                And every year, you sell enough --

           9   however old cows you sell because you sell old

          10   cows every year.  As soon as they get 11, 12

          11   years old, you sell them.  And then you keep --

          12   you try to keep that same amount because you got

          13   to remember, Mr. Jorgensen, the ultimate goal for

          14   a rancher -- because all he makes his money on is

          15   his cows -- to have as many cows as he can on the

          16   amount of land you got and not have to feed them.

          17                So if you've got a pasture that you

          18   can put a cow and a calf on every two acres then

          19   that's how many cows you can have, if you have

          20   the proper amount of water.

          21          Q.    So as I understand your calculation

          22   of damages -- so how many cows did you have to

          23   sell early at two years old?

          24          A.    You got it wrote down there

          25   someplace.

                                                                   157




           1          Q.    Well, I don't have it.  I mean,

           2   you're testifying as to your damages.  I'm asking

           3   you how you calculated them.

           4                How many cows did have you to sell

           5   early to make this computation of your damages?

           6          A.    I -- let me see my damages right

           7   there.

           8          Q.    Okay.  I don't know what it's in

           9   here but you can certainly point it out?

          10          A.    Well, I just seen it someplace.

          11   Something y'all handed to me.

          12                Well there's 23 -- there's 23 cows

          13   right there --

          14          Q.    What are you looking at?

          15          A.    -- that was sold January 2nd of '17.

          16   I would have to sit here and go through these

          17   calculations from '16 on and calculate the grown

          18   cows out of it but it will say cow.  But some

          19   place in here it talks about -- something y'all

          20   handed me.  It's in evidence, I guess.  No, here

          21   it is right here.  These cattle here was heifers

          22   that I had to sell.  I sold to Kelly Durks.

          23          Q.    2017?

          24          A.    This is correct.

          25                Here is cattle sold in September of

                                                                   158




           1   '17 to Cracker Cattle Company.

           2          Q.    And your testimony is that every one

           3   of those cows you sold had to be sold because of

           4   lack of water?

           5          A.    No.  I'm testifying that I had to

           6   sell them to make room for those that had lack of

           7   water.

           8          Q.    So you'd have less cows per acre on

           9   your pasture?

          10          A.    That's correct.

          11          Q.    All right.  And as you're a

          12   cattleman, what's the rule of thumb for how many

          13   cows you should have per acre in your area of

          14   your Sections 8 and 16?

          15          A.    Well, if I tell you, it's going to

          16   confuse you but I'll try to education you a

          17   little bit.  If you got 100 acres and you run a

          18   cow on every two acres, you say, well, you have

          19   50 head of cows; right.

          20          Q.    Got you?

          21          A.    But you forgot all the trees and all

          22   the ditches that a cow don't eat on.  So you got

          23   to calculate all that.  So when I tell you that I

          24   had 600-and-something head of bovine across that

          25   bridge on 910 acres, that's when I had good

                                                                   159




           1   water.  As a rule of thumb on the L Cross, if the

           2   conditions is right and you got water, you can

           3   run a cow -- in cowman's terms, a cow to every

           4   acre and half to two acres.

           5                Now, the Flood Control says that you

           6   run a unit, which is a cow and a calf, to every

           7   six acres.  But that's why the grass is this deep

           8   out there.  They don't put enough cows on it to

           9   keep it eat down.

          10          Q.    All right.  So just to be clear on

          11   what your damages are, you've done this

          12   calculation but you can't tell what it is at the

          13   moment, correct, as far as having to sell cows

          14   early and you've lost the ability for those cows

          15   to have calves up to ten years; correct?

          16          A.    As far as I know, I've done that.

          17          Q.    But you can't tell what that number

          18   is as we sit here today?

          19          A.    Not without looking at my paperwork.

          20          Q.    And you don't have that paperwork

          21   with you today?

          22          A.    You'd have to ask my lawyer.  I gave

          23   everything to him.

          24          Q.    In ten years, is that an average or

          25   is that when you got a really good cow that makes

                                                                   160




           1   it to ten years and still giving calves?

           2          A.    Well, you got to understand,

           3   Mr. Jorgensen, where we are is a prime piece of

           4   property.  It's the old lake bottom.  It's prime

           5   property.  A cow that's 12 years old still got

           6   all her teeth because she don't have no palm --

           7   to rip out.  She's got nice tender grass.  And

           8   that's -- that's prime property.

           9                So a cow will last longer.  If you

          10   got a little bit of Brahman blood in them, they

          11   last a little bit longer.  These Brahman cows,

          12   they last 16, 17 years.

          13          Q.    All right.  So that is one part of

          14   your damages.  What else?  Anything else that

          15   was -- that was part of your over $800,000 of

          16   damages?

          17          A.    I had lawyer fees.  I had my hay.  I

          18   had my labor, my fuel.

          19          Q.    But none in '14 or '15, right, as

          20   we've discussed?

          21          A.    No.  No.  Whoever put that in there,

          22   they said that they done that for the average --

          23   well, the price is the price.  You take the

          24   average on cattle because they fluctuate so much.

          25   But you can't take an average on -- with

                                                                   161




           1   Joe Biden in there, worm medicine cost $100 for

           2   two gallons.  Back then, it cost $45.

           3          Q.    And the damages that you're asking

           4   for or the $800,000 or in excess of $800,000, 100

           5   percent of that is caused by you not having water

           6   in the stub canal?

           7          A.    Yes.

           8          Q.    100 percent?

           9          A.    Yes, sir.  What else could it be?

          10   What you insinuating.

          11          Q.    You had rainfall?

          12          A.    Very little.

          13          Q.    You had Paradise Run.  You could

          14   have run the pump up there?

          15          A.    How can you run the pump in Paradise

          16   Run if there's no water in L-59.

          17          Q.    Well, you ran it one time and you

          18   got water out of it?

          19          A.    Yeah, but that was before they put

          20   the boards in.

          21          Q.    All right.  I think was after.

          22   But...

          23                MR. ESPY:  Argumentative.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  You're right.  No

          25          problem.  Thank you.

                                                                   162




           1                THE WITNESS:  You want this back?

           2                THE COURT:  Hang on.

           3                MR. JORGENSEN:  I don't know if

           4          Mr. Espy needs it up there.

           5                MR. ESPY:  You can hold onto it.

           6                THE COURT:  Well, hang on a second.

           7                MS. BROWN:  Did you --

           8                MR. ESPY:  Oh, I forgot about them.

           9          Sorry.

          10                THE COURT:  I didn't.

          11                MR. ESPY:  Pardon me, your Honor.

          12                MS. BROWN:  You wanted us here.  You

          13          can't forget about us.

          14                THE COURT:  I'm not forgetting about

          15          you.

          16                MS. BROWN:  Good.  Thank you.

          17   BY MS. BROWN:

          18          Q.    All right.  Let's try to wrap this

          19   up as quick as we can.

          20                You testified that you've pumped

          21   water from the L-59 because you needed it; right.

          22          A.    No, ma'am.

          23          Q.    No, you don't.  So you didn't need

          24   water from the L-59?

          25          A.    To what.

                                                                   163




           1          Q.    You didn't need water from the L-59?

           2          A.    Yeah, but you asked me if I pumped

           3   water from the L-59.  I said no, ma'am.

           4          Q.    I understand you distinction.  So

           5   let me say this, you testified that you pumped

           6   water from the cutout in the L-59 canal because

           7   you needed it?

           8          A.    Yes, ma'am.

           9          Q.    Okay.  That was a good

          10   clarification.  Thank you for your help there?

          11          A.    Okay.

          12          Q.    Okay.  So do you have Exhibit 4 up

          13   there with you still?

          14          A.    Uh-uh.  I don't know what exhibit

          15   what.

          16                THE COURT:  That's Exhibit 4.

           5   permit for water; right?

           6          A.    Yes.

           7          Q.    Okay.  And to get that permit, D.L.

           8   Pearce Ranch, Inc. had to submit an application;

          11                MS. BROWN:  All right.  I'm going to

          18   question.

          19                To get the permit for D.L. Pearce

          20   Ranch Inc.'s -- let me rephrase.

           1   at 4.

           2                MS. BROWN:  You are looking at 4.

           3                Do we have that to hand over?

           4                THE WITNESS:  Do I need to keep this

           5          one?

           6                MS. BROWN:  No, you can set it

           7          aside.

           8                THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Set it right

           9          there, Judge.

          10                THE COURT:  Hang onto it.  I'll get

          11          it back when you leave.

          12   BY MS. BROWN:

          13          Q.    Okay.  You have District Exhibit 1

          14   now; yes?

          15          A.    Yes, I do.

          16          Q.    Okay.  Great.

          17                So we just talked about Exhibit 4,

          18   which you set aside.  That was your permit for

          19   water.  Now you have the application.  So in

          20   order to get -- and that's what that document is.

          21                So in order to get that permit that

          22   we see in Exhibit 4, D.L. Pearce Ranch Inc. had

          23   to submit for an application; correct?

          24          A.    Yes, ma'am.

          25          Q.    Okay.  And was it your -- I believe

                                                                   166




           1   it was your father, D.L. Pearce, who submitted

           2   the initial application; is that correct?

           3          A.    Yes, ma'am.

           4          Q.    Okay.  The District wanted -- at

           5   some point, you submitted the application and the

           6   District sent back a letter asking for further

           7   information.  I'm going to direct you to Page 100

           8   in this document, If you look at the bottom

           9   right-hand corner.

          10                And this is the District's letter

          11   asking you for additional information; is that

          12   correct?

          13                MR. ESPY:  It's not directed to him

          14          so I object on that --

          15                MS. BROWN:  Okay.  I'll rephrase the

          16          question.

          17   BY MS. BROWN:

          18          Q.    This is the District's letter direct

          19   to D.L. Pearce Ranch Inc. that's asking for

          20   additional information; is that correct?

          21          A.    Yes.

          22          Q.    Okay.  Great.

          23                If you would turn to Page 105.  It's

          24   a yellow page.

          25                Sir, if you turn to Page 105,

                                                                   167




           1   please.  It's a yellow page.

           2                And if you take a look at this

           3   document, at the top it says water use

           4   application and the application number that's

           5   written here matches the application number on

           6   the first page.  And at the bottom it says, thank

           7   you, Mark H. Pearce with a signature.  And it

           8   looks like it says President of D.L.P Ranch Inc.

           9                So it looks to me like, Mr. Pearce,

          10   you responded to that request for additional

          11   information; correct?

          12          A.    No, that's not correct.

          13          Q.    That's not your handwriting on this

          14   page?

          15          A.    That don't make no difference.  You

          16   asked me a question about the original permit.

          17   Now you've jumped over yonder to '16.  You went

          18   from '87 to '16.

          19                MS. BROWN:  May I approach the

          20          witness, please?

          21                THE WITNESS:  Yes, ma'am.

          22                MS. BROWN:  Thank you.

          23                I'll see --

          24                THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, Judge.

          25                MS. BROWN:  -- Exhibit 4, please.

                                                                   168




           1                THE COURT:  All right.

           2                MS. BROWN:  Would you hand me

           3          Exhibit 4, please?

           4                THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

           5                MS. BROWN:  Thank you.

           6   BY MS. BROWN:

           7          Q.    Okay.  I'm pointing you to the first

           8   page of Exhibit 4?

           9                Can you just read the date right

          10   there on date issued?

          11          A.    Okay.  2016.

          12          Q.    And what's the application for?

          13   What year?

          14                If you take a look at Page 105 in

          15   the top right-hand corner, can you read the date

          16   on that?

          17                Page 105 top right-hand corner.

          18   There's a stamp date?

          19          A.    Wait just a minute.  I never seen

          20   this document.  I shouldn't say I've never seen

          21   it but -- and I'll tell you -- I can say I've

          22   never seen it because until you get to this

          23   yellow page on 105, it was all D.L. Pearce.  Now,

          24   I was amending D.L. Pearce's original permit.

          25   That's why when I put this yellow page in there,

                                                                   169




           1   they said I had to type it and I'm sorry I can't

           2   run a typewriter.

           3          Q.    So, sir --

           4          A.    Can I read this.

           5          Q.    Sure.  But the question to you is:

           6   On Page 105 in the top right-hand corner, is the

           7   date stamped May 2, 2016; yes or no?

           8          A.    Yes.

           9          Q.    Okay.  Thank you.  And you let me

          10   know when you're finished reading?

          11                You're reading Page 105; is that

          12   correct?

          13          A.    Yes.

          14          Q.    Okay.  Let me know when you're

          15   finished.

          16          A.    Go ahead.

          17          Q.    Okay.  Great?

          18                So I'm going to direct you to the

          19   bottom of the page where it says, "Thank you,

          20   Mark H. Pearce, PR, D.L.P Ranch Inc.," and then a

          21   signature.

          22                Is that your handwriting and

          23   signature at the bottom of the page?

          24          A.    Yes, it is.

          25          Q.    Okay.  And this is a response to the

                                                                   170




           1   request for information that the District wrote;

           2   correct?

           3          A.    That request for information was --

           4   that information was for the canals on the 386

           5   acres.  And I had to respond to that to show them

           6   that the -- canals are tomato farm under.  It had

           7   red checkers on it and --

           8          Q.    Sir, the question --

           9          A.    -- I did.

          10          Q.    Sir, the question is:  The District

          11   drafted a letter on November 13, 2009.  It's at

          12   Page 100.  And on Page 105, this is your response

          13   to that letter; is that correct?

          14          A.    No, ma'am.

          15          Q.    This is not your response?

          16          A.    I did not respond to a letter

          17   drafter in '09 in '16.

          18          Q.    Okay.  So is this a letter where you

          19   are responding to a request for information from

          20   the District?

          21          A.    Yes.

          22          Q.    Okay.  Take a look at -- in this

          23   letter, you've written a number of different

          24   points that you've numbered with circles.  Take a

          25   look at Number Two -- one, two, three -- four

                                                                   171




           1   lines down in Number Two?

           2                Do you see where it says see map?

           3          A.    I'm going to read number into the

           4   record:

           5                     "The base condition

           6                acreage to be used" --

           7          Q.    Sir, that's not the question before

           8   you?

           9          A.    Well, I'm going to answer your

          10   question but I'm going to read this into the

          11   record.

          12                THE COURT:  Just answer her

          13          question.  Your attorneys can have you read

          14          it in if they decide they'd like to have

          15          you do that.

          16                THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.  So Line

          17          Four -- one, two, three, four.

          18                Yes, it says see map.

          19   BY MS. BROWN:

          20          Q.    Okay.  And to Number Three?

          21                Do you see where it also says see

          22   map?

          23          A.    Yes, ma'am.

          24          Q.    Okay.  Thank you?

          25                And would you have provided -- if

                                                                   172




           1   you were referencing a map in this letter, would

           2   you have provided those maps as an addition to

           3   your letter when you submitted this to the

           4   District?

           5          A.    No.

           6          Q.    No, you would have referenced -- you

           7   would have said see map and then not provided a

           8   map to the District?

           9          A.    I can't recall if I provided a map

          10   or the map was already in the history of this

          11   permit.

          12          Q.    Okay.  So let's just continue and

          13   take an additional look.

          14                So on Page 105, we've already agreed

          15   that it's stamped May 2, 2016; correct?

          16          A.    That's what it says.

          17          Q.    Okay.  Great.  Let's go to Page 106?

          18                If you look towards kind of bottom

          19   middle, is it also stamped May 2, 2016?

          20          A.    I got to back up just a minute.  How

          21   come that says Okeechobee Service Center on it.

          22          Q.    Sir --

          23          A.    Why does that say Okeechobee Service

          24   Center?  I know you don't want to answer it

          25   but --

                                                                   173




           1                THE COURT:  All right.  Sir --

           2                THE WITNESS:  Yes, Judge.

           3                THE COURT:  -- the way this works is

           4          she gets to ask questions, you have to make

           5          answers.  Again, your attorneys can ask you

           6          questions to flesh that out if they believe

           7          it's necessary, sir.

           8   BY MS. BROWN:

           9          Q.    So, sir, on Page 106 bottom middle,

          10   is it also stamped May 2, 2016, as a received

          11   date?

          12          A.    Page 106.

          13          Q.    Uh-huh?

          14          A.    That's what it says.

          15          Q.    Okay.  Let's turn the page.  We're

          16   at 107?

          17                Bottom of the page, does it say

          18   received May 2, 2016?

          19          A.    Page 7.

          20          Q.    Page 107?

          21          A.    Yes.

          22          Q.    Okay.  And Page 108 at the bottom

          23   middle, it's also stamped received May 2, 2016?

          24          A.    Yes, it's stamped that.

          25          Q.    Okay.  Great?

                                                                   174




           1          A.    I don't agree with it.  I think it's

           2   a lie.

           3                MS. BROWN:  All right.  If you could

           4          just give me one second, your Honor.

           5                No further questions.  Thank you for

           6          your time.

           7                THE COURT:  Redirect?

           8                MR. ESPY:  Yes, sir.

           9                  REDIRECT EXAMINATION

          10   BY MR. ESPY:

          11          Q.    Mr. Pearce --

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    -- keep that exhibit?

          14          A.    I got it, buddy.

          15          Q.    Okay.  Let's go back to the part you

          16   wanted to read, the yellow page, which has got

          17   District 105, and at Paragraph 2.  You wanted to

          18   read that in the record?

          19                Would you do so at this time.  It

          20   is --

          21          A.    102, Paragraph 5.

          22          Q.    It's a yellow page.  I think it's

          23   this one?

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  105, Paragraph 2?

          25                MR. ESPY:  105, Paragraph 2.

                                                                   175




           1                THE WITNESS:  The base -- this is

           2          Paragraph 2 on Page 105 from the District

           3          that's stamped:  "Received, May 2, 2016,

           4          Okeechobee Service Center."

           5                As read:

           6                     "The base condition

           9                previously irrigated by an

          10                18-inch Pelican Pump located

          11                on Paradise Run.

          17                That is wrong.

          18                MS. BROWN:  And, your Honor, I would

          19          just object that there's also language in

          20          there that says "see map."

          21                THE COURT:  What?

          22                MS. BROWN:  There's also language in

          23          there --

           1                THE COURT:  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I can

           2          only hear one of you at a time.

           3                MS. BROWN:  That there's language in

           4          that paragraph that also says "see map."

           5                THE COURT:  Okay.

           6                MS. BROWN:  That's it.

           7                THE COURT:  Go ahead.

           8                THE WITNESS:  Okay.  That's wrong,

           9          your Honor.

          10   BY MR. ESPY:

          11          Q.    Paragraph 3 says "see map?"

          12          A.    I -- no, Paragraph 2 says it.  I

          13   didn't read it.  I don't know --

          14          Q.    No, it does say "see map?"

          15          A.    -- telling you.  But this is wrong.

          16   The pump that was previously in Paradise Run was

          17   a 12-inch pump with a 188 case motor on it.

          18                The pump for this permit is a

          19   portable pump, an 18-inch pump with an old

          20   raggedy ass Deutsche Tractor hook to it, 80 horse

          21   power Deutsche Tractor.

          22          Q.    Okay.  And -- are you finished

          23   with...?

          24          A.    No.  I want to -- can I talk --

          25          Q.    Go ahead.

                                                                   177




           1          A.    May 2, 2016, Okeechobee Service

           2   Center.  That's where Bruce Chesser works.  This

           3   was done in West Palm Beach.  Why is it stamped

           4   Okeechobee Service -- I've never seen these

           5   stamps on anything I've ever done.

           6          Q.    Okay.  Take a look at Page 107 --

           7   which is of the same exhibit?

           8          A.    Okay.  Wow.

           9          Q.    What does that depict?

          10          A.    The same thing that does right up

          11   there.

          12          Q.    Describe that for us?

          13          A.    Well, this is the land...  wow.

          14   This is the land that's north of the L-59 Canal.

          15   And this was done in -- I guess this is a picture

          16   from '14.  Again, it's stamped "16, Okeechobee

          17   Service Center."

          18          Q.    This orange line, there's some

          19   double culverts, would be down --

          20          A.    That's a blue line now.

          21          Q.    Well, the orange line is up here

          22   (indicating)?

          23          A.    Okay.

          24          Q.    Is that roughly where the?

          25          A.    -- stub canal is.

                                                                   178




           1          Q.    A -- canal?

           2          A.    That's correct.

           3          Q.    And it's describing irrigated

           4   area --

           5          A.    Yes.

           6          Q.    -- and it's -- below that, it says

           7   "18-inch portable pump?"

           8          A.    Yes.

           9          Q.    Okay.  This is part of the

          10   District's exhibit, apparently in connection with

          11   your permit request --

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    -- asking to irrigate the area from

          14   the stub canal?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    Go ahead.  You want to elaborate?

          17          A.    A while ago, I wanted to say

          18   something about the permit --

          19                MR. JORGENSEN:  Objection, your

          20          Honor.  There's no question posed.  He's

          21          just talking.

          22                MR. ESPY:  There is no question

          23          posed, Counsel.

          24                THE COURT:  If you want to pose one,

          25          go ahead.

                                                                   179




           1   BY MR. ESPY:

           2          Q.    All right.  Mr. Pearce, I do want to

           3   talk to you a couple of minutes about things you

           4   said earlier.  When you said "under ideal

           5   conditions," I think you said you need one and a

           6   half to two acres per cow in that area where 9

           7   and 16 are because that's very desirable property

           8   to raise cattle?

           9                In the case of a drought, like you

          10   had in '16/17, how does that calculus change, or

          11   what has that formula changed?

          12          A.    As the formula changed on caliper

          13   acre since '16 --

          14          Q.    Well, during the drought.  Instead

          15   of being able to --

          16          A.    Absolutely.  There was no grass.

          17          Q.    So how many acres per cow do you

          18   need in those kind of conditions?

          19          A.    I ain't never been in that shape

          20   before, Mr. Espy.

          21          Q.    Five acres or more?

          22          A.    Well, we run a test on it.  You take

          23   a pair of scissors and you cut the grass off as

          24   low as a cow can eat it in a four-, six-,

          25   eight-foot square.  Take a tape measure and

                                                                   180




           1   measure off a square.  You cut that grass off and

           2   you take that grass and weigh it.  A cow eats 10

           3   percent of her body weight.

           4                So if you've got 1,000 pound cow,

           5   she eats 100 pounds of grass a day.  You weigh

           6   that grass, and then you calculate how many

           7   four-foot squares you got in this acreage of

           8   land, and that'll tell you how many days you have

           9   left before you cows is out of grass.

          10                And the day I done that, I had 80

          11   days left.  Tommy Clay can testify to that.  He

          12   is the one that run the scissors.

          13          Q.    And so you had to sell cows because

          14   you weren't able -- you didn't have the grass to

          15   feed them?

          16          A.    That's correct.

          17          Q.    And that has entered into your

          18   calculation of these damages?

          19          A.    Absolutely.

          20          Q.    Were there 400 cows that you sold

          21   during this '16/17 period to either a company or

          22   person in Georgia?

          23                Do you recall that?

          24          A.    Yes.

          25          Q.    Who was that?

                                                                   181




           1          A.    Not Clinton Baker.  He was a farmer.

           2                I'd ask that youngin.  He could tell

           3   me, Judge.  His mind is better than mine.

           4          Q.    Well, he can't testify.  But --

           5          A.    You got him in the black --

           6          Q.    He's not on the stand?

           7          A.    You got him right in the black right

           8   there.

           9                What's it say?

          10          Q.    Say what?

          11          A.    Don't you have it where my

          12   damages -- oh, I got it myself.  Let's see.  I

          13   think that was Mr. Ketchum.  Or was it?  I think

          14   that was Mr. Ketchum.

          15          Q.    Okay.  But the sale of those cows,

          16   was that related to these problems that you were

          17   having in '16 and '17?

          18          A.    Yes.  I sold -- I sold cattle to

          19   make room for the other ones.

          20          Q.    Because you needed more room per

          21   cow?

          22          A.    Correct.

          23          Q.    Okay.  That's all I --

          24          A.    Can we look right here?  I need you

          25   to see this.

                                                                   182




           1          Q.    Going back to Exhibit 4 -- and

           2   that's Plaintiff's 4 -- I think we've gone over

           3   this, but the project description.  This is the

           4   Staff Report on page 2 of eleven, describes the

           5   project as being adjacent to the L-59 Canal, one

           6   mile west of the C-38, as shown in Exhibits 1 and

           7   2?

           8          A.    That's right.  And C-38, according

           9   to this, is right here (indicating).  That's the

          10   New Kissimmee River.  But it's been testified

          11   that Paradise Run is called C-38; that's what the

          12   flood control has testified to.

          13                That's the remnants of -- what they

          14   should have said is that it's the remnants of

          15   C-38.  It's right there, that Oxbow.  And that's

          16   where my original pump was.  But my new permit

          17   says one mile west of C-38.  Which you go

          18   straight down that line from there to there

          19   (indicating).  That's C-38 right there.

          20          Q.    One mile west is where?

          21          A.    It's the stub canal.

          22          Q.    And that's adjacent to the L-59?

          23          A.    Yes.  It says that the pump was to

          24   be -- the water was suppose to come out of C-38.

          25   Well, it can't come out of C-38, because it's my

                                                                   183




           1   opinion, the C-38 is the New Kissimmee River.

           2          Q.    And this exhibit that the District

           3   showed you this afternoon on Page 107, appears to

           4   show the irrigated area being in the area of the

           5   stub canal?

           6          A.    That's correct.  It's drawn with

           7   little red lines all over it.

           8                MR. ESPY:  All right.  That's all I

           9          have.

          10                Thank you, your Honor.

          11                THE COURT:  Recross?

          12                MR. JORGENSEN:  Briefly.

          13                   RECROSS-EXAMINATION

          14   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          15          Q.    Mr. Espy is using the word

          16   "drought."  Is it your testimony that the dry

          17   conditions in 2016 was completely a manmade

          18   drought as a result of boards in the double

          19   culverts?

          20          A.    Yes, sir.  Up until then, there

          21   wasn't no boards in there.

          22          Q.    And do you recall what the rainfall

          23   was like that year?

          24          A.    No, but I get it to you tomorrow.

          25          Q.    I'm not asking you -- so I'm just

                                                                   184




           1   trying to -- you've said it before and I just

           2   want to make sure that we're talking about what

           3   you referred to as a manmade drought --

           4          A.    Okay.

           5          Q.    -- and that the dry conditions in

           6   your property in 16 and 9 were 100 percent caused

           7   by lack of water in the stub canal versus lack of

           8   rainfall?

           9          A.    Yes, sir.

          10                MR. JORGENSEN:  All right.  That's

          11          all I have.  Thank you.

          12                MS. BROWN:  Couple of questions.

          13   BY MS. BROWN:

          14          Q.    District's Exhibit 1, can you get

          15   that in front of you again?

          16          A.    Let's see.

          17          Q.    It's the one with the yellow page.

          18                THE COURT:  That should be --

          19                MS. BROWN:  I think that's it.

          20                THE WITNESS:  This it?

          21                THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

          22   BY MS. BROWN:

          23          Q.    So can you turn to Page 105?

          24          A.    Okay.

          25          Q.    All right.  So I think you testified

                                                                   185




           1   before that you wrote this letter; correct?

           2          A.    I signed it.  Yes, ma'am.

           3          Q.    Okay.  Very good.

           4                Can you please turn to Page 107?

           5          A.    Page 107.  Yes, ma'am.

           6          Q.    This is a map and underneath the map

           7   is some handwriting.  Is that your handwriting?

           8          A.    That's correct.

           9                MS. BROWN:  Okay.  That's it.  Thank

          10          you.

          11                THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you,

          12          sir.  You may step down as soon as you give

          13          me my exhibit back.

          14                THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.  There you

          15          go.

          16                (The witness stepped down from the

          17          stand.)

          18                THE COURT:  Thank you.

          19                MR. ESPY:  Did the District -- I

          20          don't think it has offered that but we have

          21          no objection to them --

          22                THE COURT:  It hasn't.  I was going

          23          to ask them.

          24                MS. BROWN:  Yes, we'll enter that as

          25          an exhibit.  Thank you.

                                                                   186




           1                THE WITNESS:  This is yours?

           2                THE COURT:  No, sir.

           3                THE WITNESS:  I think it's

           4          Mr. Jorgenson's, ain't it?

           5                MR. JORGENSEN:  Let's see.

           6                THE COURT:  I think it's Exhibit --

           7                MR. ESPY:  This is Plaintiff's 4.

           8                MR. JORGENSEN:  It's probably mine.

           9          It is my copy.

          10                MS. BROWN:  And so it's clear on the

          11          record, the District's Exhibit 1 is now

          12          going to be entered into evidence.

          13                THE COURT:  Yes, ma'am.

          14                (Defendant's Exhibit Number 1 was

          15          offered into evidence and received by the

          16          Court.)

          17                MS. BROWN:  Thank you.

          18                THE WITNESS:  Are you done with me,

          19          Judge?

          20                THE COURT:  Yes, sir.  You can sit

          21          back down -- well, we are for right now.

          22                Call your next witness.

          23                MR. ESPY:  Tommy Clay.

          24                MR. BREWER:  Can we use the restroom

          25          before we start?

                                                                   187




           1                THE COURT:  Yes, sir.  I'll tell you

           2          what, I might as well give everybody about

           3          ten minutes and then we'll come back and

           4          push through.

           5                THE BAILIFF:  All rise.  Court's in

           6          recess.

           7                (There was a pause in the

           8          proceedings from 2:31 p.m. until 2:40 p.m.)

           9                THE COURT:  Call the next witness.

          10                MR. ESPY:  Thomas Clay.

          11                THE COURT:  Raise your arm and step

          12          forward, please.

          13                Raise your right hand.

          14                Do you solemnly swear or affirm the

          15          testimony you're about to give in this

          16          cause shall be the truth, the whole truth

          17          and nothing but the truth?

          18                THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

          19   Thereupon,

          20                      THOMAS CLAY,

          21   having been first duly sworn or affirmed, was

          22   examined and testified as follows:

          23                THE COURT:  Have a seat right up

          24          there, sir.

          25

                                                                   188




           1                   DIRECT EXAMINATION

           2   BY MR. ESPY:

           3          Q.    Good afternoon.

           4          A.    Good afternoon.

           5          Q.    Tell the Court your full name, sir.

           6          A.    Thomas Leroy Clay.

           7          Q.    And where do you live?

           8          A.    Okeechobee, Florida.

           9          Q.    And, Mr. Clay, was there a time you

          10   were employed by the D.L. Pearce Ranch?

          11          A.    Yes, sir.  March of '13 to August of

          12   '17.

          13          Q.    And during that time, what were your

          14   job duties?

          15          A.    Mostly taking care of the land --

          16   you know, mowing, aerating.  And then Mr. Pearce

          17   found out that I knew a little bit about feed so

          18   then I got to feed some cattle for him.

          19          Q.    When you say "Mr. Pearce," I get

          20   that you --

          21          A.    Mr. D.L.

          22          Q.    D.L. Pearce?

          23          A.    Yes, sir.

          24          Q.    And do you recall a period of time

          25   where there was a problem with water getting to

                                                                   189




           1   Sections 9 and 17 and how it affected D.L. Pearce

           2   Ranch's cattle?

           3          A.    Yes, sir.

           4          Q.    And can you describe -- first of

           5   all, what were doing for the company at that

           6   point in time?

           7          A.    At that point, Mr. Pearce had passed

           8   on and I was helping Mark Hunter, as we all call

           9   him, with the books and, you know, the day-to-day

          10   operations of the ranch.  And so I was involved

          11   in pretty much all the decision making helping

          12   him.

          13          Q.    Okay.  Now, the dry season typically

          14   is what time of year for cattle?

          15          A.    It varies in Florida.  As

          16   Mr. Jorgensen said, it varies.  You know, we can

          17   hit some in winter months right now.  We can hit

          18   some in the spring.  You just never know what

          19   you're going to get.

          20          Q.    What was the winter of 2016 like?

          21          A.    It was -- and, again, I'm going off

          22   of memory here.  So there was rainfall but not a

          23   lot.  We needed water to supplement it and we

          24   didn't get water to supplement it.  Before --

          25   before when the culvert didn't have risers on

                                                                   190




           1   them, the water just free flowed.  So it was --

           2   you didn't worry about those things.

           3          Q.    Okay.  So do you recall a time

           4   around November of 2017 when this problem that

           5   was created by the boards being in the risers

           6   started to really affect the D.L. Pearce Ranch

           7   operation?

           8          A.    Yes, sir.  It was -- it was a

           9   definite impact.  You could stand in the bottom

          10   of the L-59 next to the culverts and not get your

          11   feet wet on our side.

          12          Q.    On the east side?

          13          A.    Yes, sir.

          14          Q.    Okay.  And for how long a period of

          15   time did that situation continue?

          16          A.    I left in '17 and I don't think the

          17   Judge had ordered the boards out yet when I left.

          18   So there was still in when I left.

          19          Q.    And how did you see that the problem

          20   created by that lack of water spread to the ranch

          21   operations?

          22          A.    Well, it goes back to not being able

          23   to run the cow/calf ratio to acreage and then you

          24   feed a lot more; and, you know, you go through

          25   and cut your herd back.  You sell your older

                                                                   191




           1   cattle so you can keep your younger cattle and

           2   then ween it up some a lot of younger cattle,

           3   too.

           4          Q.    Why?

           5          A.    Just had no place for them.

           6          Q.    When you say "had no place for

           7   them," what does that mean?

           8          A.    That means we couldn't grow the

           9   grass to support them so we were having to

          10   support them either with hay from across the

          11   street from Mr. Harvey or from Walpole,

          12   Incorporated through the liquid feeds and stuff

          13   that I use.

          14          Q.    Because the grass was so short?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    And this condition that started

          17   towards November of 2016 was still ongoing when

          18   you left?

          19          A.    Still going on.  There was still

          20   boards in the culvert, still no water on L-59 on

          21   our side.

          22          Q.    Now, did this problem have anything

          23   to do with you leaving the employment of

          24   D.L. Pearce Ranch?

          25          A.    It did.  And, you know, my plan was

                                                                   192




           1   to go out there and -- and die out there.  But,

           2   you know, Caleb come home and there wasn't enough

           3   to maintain both of us so I have another career.

           4   So I just went back to that for now.

           5          Q.    Now, did you say earlier that you

           6   prepared the checks for Mark Hunter to sign?

           7          A.    Yes, sir.

           8          Q.    And are you familiar with how the

           9   expenses of the D.L. Pearce Ranch operation

          10   changed during this period of time that began

          11   around 2016 and was still continuing when you

          12   left in August of 2017?

          13          A.    Yeah, our expenses increased due to

          14   feed costs.  And so your feed goes up -- feed is

          15   one of your -- it's like fuel on a semi.  It's

          16   your most expensive piece.  So we had to buy a

          17   lot more feed.

          18          Q.    Because there wasn't grass?

          19          A.    Because there wasn't grass.  And

          20   so -- and, again, I have a connection with the

          21   Walpole family so that's the reason we bought so

          22   much feed from them.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And what were the monthly

          24   expenses of the -- approximate monthly expenses

          25   of the ranch operation in the period of time

                                                                   193




           1   leading up to November of 2016?

           2          A.    It's -- I'm know I'm not supposed to

           3   elaborate on things, but we always laugh because

           4   Mr. Pearce -- Mr. D.L. would always come to me

           5   and Mark and say, "Hey, you got some more cows

           6   hid somewhere?  I need $20,000."  And we thought

           7   he was stuffing this money in the bank, but he

           8   wasn't.  That's what it costs to run the ranch

           9   every month.  18 to 20 was our costs.  And,

          10   again, that had been ongoing from the time he had

          11   it until we took it over when he passed.

          12          Q.    And how -- and to what extent did

          13   those expenses increase?

          14                Now, you're writing the checks so

          15   you're aware of this; is that --

          16          A.    Right.  Yeah, you see everything

          17   going up especially your feed cost.  And, again,

          18   going off of memory, I think probably the most we

          19   ever spent was 45 a month, I want to -- I would

          20   guess.  And you're --

          21          Q.    I don't want you to guess.  I mean,

          22   is that your best recollection?

          23          A.    Best recollection, yes, sir.  But

          24   you're also -- you're worming more, you're doing

          25   more to keep your cows healthy.  Because, like

                                                                   194




           1   Mark says, when you're eating down in that lower

           2   grass, you're picking up worms, you're picking up

           3   parasites that you don't normally get at the top

           4   of the grass.  So there's a lot of things that

           5   drive that.

           6          Q.    Well, and -- drive the increase to

           7   expenses?

           8          A.    Yes.

           9          Q.    All right.  And, now, we've talked

          10   about the increase feed, the increase worming

          11   expense.  What other factors would fall in there?

          12          A.    It was the feed and the -- you know,

          13   that was -- and, you know, the cost of cowboys

          14   coming in and -- because you're going through

          15   your cattle more.  Usually, we went for our cows

          16   four times a year.  Now we're having to ride

          17   them -- if you see anything getting more, you've

          18   either got to get rid of it or get it somewhere

          19   where you can feed it more than what you're

          20   feeding the group it's with.

          21          Q.    Okay.  And having to worm them more

          22   often requires more labor, too?

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    So what is your best recollection as

          25   to the approximate expense the ranch -- it went

                                                                   195




           1   from 18 to 20 beginning in November of 2016

           2   through August of 2017, what was the range of

           3   those expenses?

           4          A.    Again, your feed costs more than

           5   doubled because you're -- you know, we were

           6   putting out -- we originally started with, like,

           7   five molasses feeder that they allowed me to have

           8   out there.  And by the end of it, we probably had

           9   20 up.  And back then every time that truck came,

          10   it was -- and I'm going off memory -- I want to

          11   say it was about $2,000 a feeder.  And we went

          12   from feeding them -- putting feed out once a

          13   month to putting it out weekly, you know.  And we

          14   rotated that.  So...

          15          Q.    So what would you estimate based on

          16   your recollection that the expenses ran that

          17   period from November of 2016 through August of

          18   2017 on a monthly basis?

          19          A.    30 to 40.

          20          Q.    And you said one month got as high

          21   as...

          22          A.    45, I think.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And then -- the -- did the

          24   ranch lose money on any of the cows it sold

          25   because they were malnourished?

                                                                   196




           1          A.    Well, you don't get the premium when

           2   you sell an old cow.  You're not going to get a

           3   premium price for an old cow anyway.  But when

           4   you sell a poor, old cow, yeah, you drop from,

           5   you know, $1 a pound down to $0.70 a pound or

           6   whatever.  And so everything -- fat, healthy

           7   cattle bring more money.  It's simple.

           8          Q.    And could you give us an estimate of

           9   what the ranch lost in terms of the market value

          10   of the cows during that period of time you were

          11   there?

          12          A.    I would have to sit down and go

          13   through the numbers.  I mean, we were probably at

          14   1,200 head when I -- when that hit.  And when I

          15   left, we were probably down closer to 850.  So if

          16   you do just the calf crop that you lost, you

          17   know, on those -- what is that -- 200 or 300, 350

          18   head that were had downsized.  So calves at the

          19   time would bring $700 to $900.  So 350 times

          20   that.

          21          Q.    350 times?

          22          A.    The 700.

          23          Q.    And at the time you left, the

          24   increased expenses are still being incurred?

          25          A.    Uh-huh.  When I left in August of

                                                                   197




           1   '17.

           2          Q.    That's a "yes;" right?

           3          A.    Yes.  Yes.  I'm sorry.

           4          Q.    And to your knowledge that continued

           5   until the boards were eventually taken out by the

           6   Judge's order?

           7          A.    As far as I know.  Yes, sir.

           8          Q.    Thank you.

           9                During the times these boards were

          10   in after November -- well, 2016 to 2017, compare

          11   and contrast what the water looked like on the

          12   west side of the double culverts compared to the

          13   east side.

          14          A.    I would say it was like 18 feet, 17

          15   to 18 feet.

          16          Q.    On the west side?

          17          A.    On the west side and on our side

          18   nothing.

          19          Q.    Nothing?

          20          A.    Nothing.

          21                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  Thank you.  That's

          22          all.

          23                THE COURT:  Cross-examination.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  Thank you, Judge.

                                                                   198




           1                    CROSS-EXAMINATION

           2   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           3          Q.    How long have you known Mark Pearce?

           4          A.    Mark and I have been really good

           5   friends since '13.  I've known Mark Pearce

           6   probably 40 years but been really good friends

           7   since '13.

           8          Q.    Are you from Glades County or...?

           9          A.    No, I'm from Okeechobee County.

          10          Q.    Okay.  And you touched a little bit

          11   on what the rainfall looked like in 2016.  Was it

          12   a -- do you recall whether winter/spring of '16

          13   was a dry time or not?

          14          A.    It was a dry time.  It was dry and,

          15   again, magnified by the boards.

          16          Q.    All right.  And was it unusually dry

          17   dramatically or not?

          18          A.    Not -- you know, we were doing fine

          19   on the other side when we had -- on the other

          20   side of the canal.  But we had nothing on that

          21   side so you couldn't really compare the two

          22   because I can make grass grow on one side and I

          23   can't make it grow on the other.

          24          Q.    And you're familiar with the pump at

          25   Paradise Run?

                                                                   199




           1          A.    I'm familiar with the pump on what

           2   y'all are now calling the stub canal.

           3          Q.    Did you ever calibrate the pump that

           4   was at Paradise Run?

           5          A.    I had it calibrated.

           6          Q.    And it was at Paradise Run at the

           7   time it was calibrated?

           8          A.    I'm sure it was calibrated at the

           9   barn.

          10          Q.    At the barn?

          11          A.    They've done it by dimension RPMs

          12   and -- whatever they do.

          13          Q.    And it didn't actually pump water

          14   then when it's calibrated, they just do some --

          15          A.    She didn't.

          16          Q.    Okay.  All right.

          17          A.    And she didn't -- when the other

          18   one -- she went down and got all the numbers off

          19   of it and done the same thing for the other one.

          20          Q.    What other one.

          21          A.    The ridge.

          22          Q.    Okay.  That's a different --

          23          A.    Different property.

          24                (Simultaneously speaking.)

          25                THE WITNESS:  But I had her do both.

                                                                   200




           1   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           2          Q.    All right.  And the pump that you

           3   had calibrated that was at the barn, was it ever

           4   at Paradise Run when you were there?

           5          A.    I don't ever remember it being at

           6   Paradise Run when I was there.  But I went there,

           7   again, in '13.  Probably started really working

           8   on the ranch -- on that end of the ranch probably

           9   '14.

          10          Q.    That end of the ranch being what?

          11          A.    The --

          12          Q.    Near --

          13          A.    Paradise Run.

          14          Q.    All right.  And did you ever operate

          15   the pump in -- when you were there in '16 and

          16   '17?

          17          A.    Uh-uh.

          18          Q.    "No"?

          19          A.    No.

          20          Q.    Okay.

          21          A.    That's not what I did.

          22          Q.    Okay.  Did you -- did anyone at

          23   Pearce Ranch operate the pump in 2016/2017 to

          24   your knowledge.

          25          A.    Not that I know of because there

                                                                   201




           1   wasn't no water.

           2          Q.    But there would have been water at

           3   the beginning of 2016, wouldn't there have --

           4          A.    I don't recall there being too much

           5   water.  I don't remember.  I'm not going to sit

           6   here and lie to you and tell you I know something

           7   that I don't.  So I can't honestly answer that.

           8          Q.    Do you remember when the boards went

           9   into the double culverts -- the new beards?

          10          A.    I don't remember the date but I

          11   remember when they dug the -- I remember them

          12   digging the culverts out and putting the new

          13   culverts in.  I don't remember the date.  No,

          14   sir.

          15          Q.    And how do you know about that?

          16          A.    What do you mean how do I know --

          17          Q.    How did you know that that was going

          18   on?

          19          A.    I was up there.

          20          Q.    Okay.  But that's not really on

          21   Pearce Ranch's property; right?

          22          A.    It borders it.

          23          Q.    Okay.

          24          A.    And when you're driving cows up the

          25   land, you see it.

                                                                   202




           1          Q.    And there's been testimony about the

           2   stub canal and Mr. Pearce has testified about

           3   damages that he suffered -- or that Pearce Ranch

           4   has suffered as a result of loss of water in the

           5   stub canal.  Based on what you observed and what

           6   the damages that you've talked about today, was

           7   all that caused by lack of water in the stub

           8   canal?

           9          A.    Lack of water in the L-59 feeding to

          10   the stub canal, yes.

          11          Q.    And was there no water to get from

          12   Paradise Run?

          13          A.    You can't get down in there.

          14          Q.    Okay.  And how about rainfall?  Did

          15   that not help during the summers of 2016 and

          16   2017?

          17          A.    We did cut grass comparisons just

          18   like Mark said.  We brought a guy in out of

          19   Gainesville.  And, like I said, we had 65 or 80

          20   days of grass -- I don't know the date that we

          21   did that.

          22          Q.    All right.  So you went down

          23   approximately 350 head; is that correct?

          24          A.    At least 350.

          25          Q.    Okay.  And you said an average

                                                                   203




           1   cost -- or price of -- is like $700 to $900?

           2          A.    I think that's what it was then.

           3   Again, you'd have to look at the numbers that --

           4   of the market.

           5          Q.    And this $700 to $900, is that for a

           6   healthy two-year-old or...?

           7          A.    That's a healthy feeder calf.

           8          Q.    Okay.  And when they're --

           9          A.    That was then.

          10          Q.    Okay.  When they're under -- when

          11   they're skinny, they sell for less?

          12          A.    They sell for less.

          13          Q.    When you mentioned 315 head, you

          14   throw out, what, $700 or $900 a head, and that

          15   would be part of the damages?

          16          A.    I think so.

          17          Q.    Okay.  What else?

          18          A.    Your feed costs.

          19          Q.    All right.

          20          A.    And, you know, your labor cost, your

          21   lack of production that you're going to have

          22   going forward.  You just cut your herd by 350

          23   head.

          24          Q.    Okay.  Explain that lack of

          25   production.

                                                                   204




           1          A.    Well, you just your herd from 1,200

           2   to, let's say, 850.

           3          Q.    Right.

           4          A.    So you're -- for the next ten years

           5   until you build that herd back, and you're not

           6   going to get those 350 head back in one year, two

           7   years -- maybe three, maybe.  But you still got

           8   to -- you know, a two- to three-year-old cow --

           9   depending on the breed.  You know, so how long do

          10   you say the damages go, you know.  I mean, so

          11   those cows that we got rid of -- those heifers we

          12   got rid of all would have went 11, 12 years.

          13   That's probably a solid average on the L Cross

          14   Ranch.

          15          Q.    And how many calves a year?

          16          A.    At that point, we were doing about

          17   92 percent calf ratio.

          18          Q.    Is that for one calf per year or how

          19   calves per year does a healthy cow produce?

          20          A.    One.

          21          Q.    Okay.  And you were saying you were

          22   doing about what percent?

          23          A.    Before the water was cut off, we

          24   were at 92 percent.

          25          Q.    All right.  And after the water was

                                                                   205




           1   cut off, you were at what?

           2          A.    Again, I left in '17 so I can't

           3   answer that number honestly from me.

           4          Q.    Okay.  And you just testified I

           5   think that it takes, what, two or three years to

           6   build the herd back up?

           7          A.    It'll take -- depending on how many

           8   replacement heifers you can hold back.

           9          Q.    Explain that -- how many replacement

          10   heifers you can hold back.  What do you mean by

          11   that?

          12          A.    Okay.  You've got to have a place to

          13   put them, which we didn't, the next year because

          14   we were still dumping in -- when would that have

          15   been -- '16.  So if you're going to hold 300

          16   head -- but we usually held like 125 head back.

          17   So we couldn't do that because we didn't have

          18   nowhere to put them.  Because most of the time

          19   out heifers went across the bridge in what we

          20   call the beef pasture.  And the beef pasture is

          21   the pasture that's parallel to the Paradise Run.

          22          Q.    All right.  Was there any -- did you

          23   rotate cattle anywhere to try to --

          24          A.    We had to.

          25          Q.    Where did you rotate them to?

                                                                   206




           1          A.    We put some across the bridge.  The

           2   rest were sold because we had it -- you're

           3   running capacities on everything.  So your

           4   capacity is across the bridge.  And at the other

           5   properties, you're rotating those cattle.

           6                So when you take cattle from over

           7   here, now you're overloading your capacities to

           8   rotate.  So you mess up your whole formula.  So

           9   to keep from messing all that up, we had to dump

          10   what we had on the north side.

          11          Q.    All right.  So I understand your

          12   testimony.  You're talking about replacement of

          13   the herd.  Is that just done through calves being

          14   born or --

          15          A.    Yes, sir.  We don't --

          16          Q.    You don't buy any?

          17          A.    Uh-uh.  The only thing that you

          18   might go buy is a bull.  But you buy no

          19   replacement heifers.  I mean, everything we do is

          20   from that -- from right there.

          21          Q.    When's the last time you've been out

          22   to the Pearce Ranch?

          23          A.    I was on -- I was on the grade

          24   Sunday.

          25          Q.    What's the herd like now?

                                                                   207




           1          A.    I didn't go in the herd.

           2          Q.    Okay.  Have you observed the herd

           3   since you left in 2017?

           4          A.    Yep.

           5          Q.    When was the last time you observed

           6   it?

           7          A.    Probably rode it two months ago with

           8   Mark.

           9          Q.    Okay.  How many head?

          10          A.    I didn't count them.

          11          Q.    Okay.  What did it look like?

          12          A.    They're all fat and sassy.

          13          Q.    Has the herd been replenished --

          14          A.    Couldn't answer that.

          15                MR. JORGENSEN:  Okay.  That's all I

          16          have, sir.

          17                THE COURT:  District, cross-examine?

          18                MR. GLASS:  The District has no

          19          questions, your Honor.

          20                THE COURT:  All right.  Redirect?

          17                   DIRECT EXAMINATION

          18   BY MR. ESPY:

          19          Q.    Good afternoon, sir.

          20          A.    Good afternoon.

          21          Q.    Thanks for -- thanks for waiting.

          22                Tell the Court your full name,

          23   please.

          24          A.    Thomas Perry.

          25          Q.    And where do you live?

                                                                   209




           1          A.    I live in Moore Haven.

           2          Q.    What's your occupation, sir.

           3          A.    I'm an engineer.

           4          Q.    Could you give us a brief summary of

           5   your education, training, and experience as an

           6   engineer.

           7          A.    Yes, sir.  I have a Bachelor's and

           8   Master's degree in Engineering from the

           9   University of Florida.  And I've worked in the

          10   engineering field in Hendry County -- Hendry and

          11   Glades County for last 32 or 33 years.

          12          Q.    In the course of your work, have you

          13   had occasion to do work for Jeanette Peeples?

          14          A.    I have.

          15          Q.    When did you first work for her

          16   approximately?

          17          A.    In the mid-2010s.

          18          Q.    And do you recall what you were

          19   asked to do when you were first hired by her?

          20          A.    I believe the first thing I did for

          21   her directly would be to change the permitting

          22   name on the double culverts.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And what was the double

          24   culverts permit?

          25          A.    It's the permit for the two 60-inch

                                                                   210




           1   culverts in the L-59 canal.

           2          Q.    And the first time, you said you

           3   were asked to change what?

           4          A.    Change the permit into her name --

           5   into PV Ranch solely.

           6          Q.    What was it PV Ranch first or was it

           7   changed first into some other names?  And if you

           8   don't recall, I've got an exhibit.

           9          A.    Prior to that, we had changed the

          10   permit so that it was to PV Ranch and -- I don't

          11   remember if it said Twin Sisters or if it said

          12   Peeples Employer that -- Peeples Employer or Twin

          13   Sisters.

          14          Q.    I'm going to hand you something to

          15   see if it helps you.  I'm going to hand you

          16   Plaintiff's 33 for identification.

          17                Mr. Perry, let me hand you what

          18   we've marked as Plaintiff's 32 for

          19   identification.  And do you recognize that?

          20          A.    Yes.

          21          Q.    All right.  So was this the first

          22   right of way occupancy permit transfer request

          23   you worked on?

          24          A.    Yes, sir.

          25          Q.    Okay.  And it looks like at that

                                                                   211




           1   time -- directing your attention to Page Three,

           2   who held the permit for the -- from the District

           3   for the double culverts at the time this was

           4   prepared in October of 2015?

           5          A.    I don't remember but I think it was

           6   a historic name on it at that time.

           7          Q.    Okay.  I'm looking at -- now, the

           8   third page says:

           9                     "To whom it may

          10                concern, the parties

          18                PV Ranch LLC have

          19                agreed PV Ranch LLC

          20                will operate the

           2                benefits of the all

           3                parties."

           4                Do you see that?

           5          A.    Yes.

           6          Q.    Did you prepare this page?

           7          A.    Probably.

           8          Q.    Okay.  And it's signed by Jeanette

           9   Peeples, trustee of the Jeanette Peeples Trust.

          10   Do you see that?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    Dated October 2, 2015.  It's signed

          13   by John Austin Collier on October 2, 2015.

          14   Byron Storey.  See that?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    Kim Collier and Janet Storey -- all

          17   of them signing it on October 2, 2015.  Were

          18   those the five people that held the permit at

          19   that time?

          20          A.    No because we transferred it to

          21   these five.

          22          Q.    Okay.

          23          A.    As I remember.  But let me look

          24   back.  Let me say that -- let me correct myself.

          25   Prior to this, we transferred into this five

                                                                   213




           1   names.

           2          Q.    Okay.

           3          A.    And this transferred out of the five

           4   names into the PV Ranch name.

           5          Q.    Okay.  So prior to this, you

           6   transferred it from Ms. Peeples, individually,

           7   into these five names?

           8          A.    I don't remember but I want to say

           9   we transferred it from maybe the L Cross Ranch or

          10   Rosa Lee Hall -- I mean, Rosa Lee Pearce.

          11          Q.    But you don't recall?

          12          A.    I don't recall.

          13          Q.    Do you recall the reason for

          14   transferring it to these five people --

          15   Ms. Peeples, trustee; John Austin Collier,

          16   Byron Storey, Kim Collier, and Janet Storey?

          17          A.    What I remember is that the entity

          18   whose name it was in didn't exist and this was an

          19   attempt to get it into the name of those people

          20   who were served by the culvert.

          21          Q.    Okay.  Let me give you this one.  I

          22   may have gotten these a little out of order.

          23   This is Plaintiff's Exhibit 33.  Let me hand you

          24   this, Mr. Perry -- Plaintiff's Exhibit 33.

          25                And is that front page a letter that

                                                                   214




           1   you prepared in January of 2014 to Jorge Patino

           2   at the District?

           3          A.    Yes.

           4          Q.    So would this have been the first

           5   work you did?

           6          A.    Yes, sir.

           7          Q.    Okay.  So this transfers it from

           8   Jeanette Peeples, individually, to Jeanette

           9   Peeples as trustee, John Austin Collier,

          10   Kim Collier, Byron Storey, and Janet Storey?

          11          A.    Yes, sir.

          12          Q.    And this is Permit 106-46?

          13          A.    Yes, sir.

          14          Q.    Which was the permit the District

          15   issued to operate the risers at the double

          16   culverts.

          17          A.    Yes.

          18          Q.    All right.  So you submitted this.

          19   And did the District approved the 2014 change?

          20          A.    Yes, sir.

          21                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  So I'll offer

          22          Plaintiff's 33 into evidence at this time.

          23                THE COURT:  Any objection?

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  No objection.

           1                THE COURT:  33 will be admitted.

           2                (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 33 was

           3          offered into evidence and received by the

           4          Court.)

           5   BY MR. ESPY:

           6          Q.    And then after that, Plaintiff's 32

           7   was submitted which changed the names from

           8   Jeanette Peeples trustee, John Austin Collier,

           9   Kim Collier, Byron Storey, Janet Storey to PV

          10   Ranch LLC?

          11          A.    Yes, sir.

          12          Q.    And that was submitted in October of

          13   2015?

          14          A.    Yes, sir.

          15                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  We'll offer 32 --

          16          Plaintiff's 32 for ID and evidence at this

          17          time.

          18                MR. JORGENSEN:  No objection.

          19                MR. GLASS:  No objection.

          20                THE COURT:  32 will be admitted.

          21                (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 32 was

          22          offered into evidence and received by the

          23          Court.)

          24                MR. ESPY:  This is Plaintiff's 36

          25          for ID.

                                                                   216




           1                So -- do you want to see this?  It's

           2          a letter.

           3                THE COURT:  I think he held his hand

           4          out.

           5                MR. ESPY:  I have a copy of it.

           6   BY MR. ESPY:

           7          Q.    Let me hand you Plaintiff's 36 for

           8   ID, Mr. Perry, and ask you if this is a letter

           9   you received from the South Florida Water

          10   Management District dated February 15, 2016?

          11          A.    Yes, sir.

          12          Q.    Okay.  Would you have received it

          13   close in time to the date of that letter?

          14          A.    Yes.

          15          Q.    And this advised you that the permit

          16   changed had been approved and that Permit 106-46

          17   was now in the name of PV Ranch; is that right?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19                MR. ESPY:  We'll offer Plaintiff's

          20          36 for ID and evidence at this time.

          21                MR. JORGENSEN:  No objection.

          22                MR. GLASS:  No objection.

          23                THE COURT:  36 will be admitted.

           1                (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 36 was

           2          offered into evidence and received by the

           3          Court.)

           4                MR. ESPY:  And then, Mr. Perry, I'm

           5          going to show you what we've marked as 31

           6          for ID.  These numbers are skipping around

           7          a little bit.

           8                THE COURT:  Didn't we already have a

           9          31?

          10                THE CLERK:  That's what I'm

          11          checking.

          12                MR. ESPY:  That might already been

          13          in then.

          14                THE CLERK:  I have 32.

          15                THE COURT:  Okay.  Not 31?

          16                THE CLERK:  No, sir.

          17                THE COURT:  All right.  I could have

          18          sworn I remember someone talking about 31

          19          earlier.  Okay.  Mark it as 31 then.

          20                MR. ESPY:  Thank you.

          21   BY MR. ESPY:

          22          Q.    Mr. Perry, handing you what we've

          23   marked as Plaintiff's 31 for identification, is

          24   this the Permit 106-46 reflecting the change in

          25   February of 2016 marked by the District?

                                                                   218




           1          A.    Yes, sir.

           2          Q.    Okay.  So prior to February 15,

           3   2016, Permit 106-46 pertaining to the double

           4   culverts was owned by John Austin Collier, Kim

           5   Collier, Byron Storey, Janet Storey, and Jeanette

           6   Peeples as trustee?

           7          A.    Yes, sir.

           8          Q.    And then after February 15, 2016,

           9   was it owned by PV Ranch?

          10          A.    Yes, sir.

          11          Q.    Now, in connection with that, are

          12   you aware of a letter -- are you aware of a

          13   letter -- and I'll hand you what we've marked as

          14   Plaintiff's 62 in evidence.  Have you seen this

          15   before?

          16          A.    I don't think I have.

          17          Q.    Are you aware that it is the

          18   District's position that the operation of the

          19   boards and the risers of the double culverts is

          20   left to the discretion of the permittee, PV

          21   Ranch?

          22          A.    Yes.

          23          Q.    You were aware of that?

          24          A.    Yes.

          25          Q.    Okay.  And, therefore, since the use

                                                                   219




           1   of the boards is left to the discretion of the

           2   permittee there would have been no staging

           3   requirements for the permittee as to the west

           4   side of the double culverts?

           5          A.    Correct.

           6                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  And I would offer

           7          Plaintiff's 31.  I don't think I did before

           8          offer Plaintiff's 31 for ID and to evidence

           9          at this time.

          10                MR. JORGENSEN:  No objection.

          11                MR. GLASS:  No objection.

          12                THE COURT:  Okay.  It'll be

          13          admitted.

          14                (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 31 was

          15          offered into evidence and received by the

          16          Court.)

          17   BY MR. ESPY:

          18          Q.    When were -- if you recall, when

          19   were the culverts replaced during the time frame

          20   you worked for Ms. Peeples?

          21          A.    I do not recall.

          22          Q.    But during the time you worked for

          23   her, they were replaced at some point?

          24          A.    Yes.

          25          Q.    Did you ever direct anyone as to how

                                                                   220




           1   the boards -- if the board should be placed and

           2   to what extent the boards should be placed in the

           3   risers?

           4          A.    I don't remember a particular

           5   incidence.  My direction would have been that the

           6   permittee can operate the structure as they see

           7   fit.  The permittee can operate the structure as

           8   they see fit.

           9          Q.    But you are aware of the '62

          10   agreement, are you not?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    Okay.  In fact, you attached the '62

          13   agreement to the District in connection with at

          14   least one -- I think more than one -- of these

          15   permit changes that you asked for?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    And you're aware that the '62

          18   agreement provides that the risers shall be

          19   operated in a fashion that beneficial to all

          20   members of the family and all users of the canal;

          21   right?

          22                MR. ESPY:  Let me -- rather than me

          23          paraphrasing it.  May I approach the

          24          witness, your Honor?

          25                THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

                                                                   221




           1   BY MR. ESPY:

           2          Q.    You're aware, Mr. Perry, of the

           3   language in the '62 agreement that provides that

           4   the purpose of the headers is to give better

           5   water control to the parties, defendant, and

           6   other owners served by Levee 59 and its borrow

           7   canal?

           8          A.    Yes, sir, that is what the agreement

           9   says.

          10          Q.    And your advice in connection with

          11   the replacement of the boards and the use of the

          12   culvert would have been consistent with the '62

          13   agreement; right?

          14          A.    Yes.

          15          Q.    Because you were aware of it?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    And you were sensitive enough to it

          18   that you sent it to the District each time you

          19   went throughout this permit transfer process;

          20   right?

          21          A.    I wouldn't say that's the only

          22   reason I sent it.  That would be part of, yes.

          23                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  Thank you.

          24                I'm done.

          25                THE COURT:  Okay.

                                                                   222




           1                MR. JORGENSEN:  If I may, your

           5          Q.    Good afternoon, Mr. Perry?

           6          A.    Good afternoon.

           7          Q.    Have you done a lot of work in and

           8   around the L-59 canal?

           9          A.    A fair amount, yes.

          10          Q.    And describe to this Court what type

          11   of work you've done.

          12          A.    It's always been for some of the

          13   Pearce families and it's typically been

          14   permitting work.

          15          Q.    And what type of permitting, if you

          16   recall?

          17          A.    Permitting the structures along the

          18   canal and water use permit for someone to use for

          19   something.

          20          Q.    And because -- and for how many

          21   years have you been doing that?

          22          A.    I want to say for ten or more.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And based on that work -- and

          24   how long have you been employed as an engineer?

          25          A.    Since 1991.

                                                                   223




           1          Q.    Okay.  And since 1991, have you

           2   done -- I mean, you've mentioned some of the

           3   permitting you work for around the L-59.  Are you

           4   otherwise familiar with the Indian Prairie Basin?

           5          A.    Yes, sir.

           6          Q.    And how are you familiar with it?

           7          A.    I mean, I've done other work in the

           8   Basin.  I've done work for others in the Basin.

           9          Q.    And are you familiar with the

          10   permitting -- about the permits that have been

          11   issued for use of water in the L-59 canal?

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    And is there a limited amount of --

          14   is there a -- is the water in the L-59 canal a

          15   limited resource?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    Okay.  Are there any permits

          18   available currently that you're aware of that

          19   someone could acquire to use water out of the

          20   L-59?

          21                MR. ESPY:  Objection, relevancy.

          22                THE COURT:  Overruled.

           4          A.    Yes.

           6                MR. ESPY:  Objection; lack of

           7          predicate, calls for speculation.

           8                THE COURT:  Unless you have had

           9          direct communications and don't -- don't

          10          speculate, sir.

          13   with the District over the years in the

          14   permitting process and over things that you've --

          15   have you done other work -- has your work

          16   involved -- has your work in, you know, applying

          17   for and getting permits issues caused you to

          18   interact with the District?

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    And have you interacted with the

          21   District on other issues involving water over the

          22   course of your career.

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    Okay.  And based on those

          25   interactions and -- and I assume you have

                                                                   225

           5          Q.    Okay.  And based on that, is the

           6   District sensitive about water loss in the Indian

           7   Prairie Basin?

           8                MR. ESPY:  Calls for -- objection;

           9          calls for hearsay, speculative.

          10                THE COURT:  Overruled.

          11                MR. JORGENSEN:  Go ahead.

          12                THE WITNESS:  They are sensitive.

          15   about the 1962 stipulation on direct and you've

          16   testified that the staging of the water at the

          17   L-59 canal at the double culverts is

          18   discretionary with the permittee; correct?

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    Okay.  And the staging of the water

          21   at the L-59 canal, does it assist in keeping the

          22   elevation of the water west of the double

          23   culverts at a certain level which would allow for

          24   the consumptive-use permit holders west of the

          25   canal to be able to get their allocations of

                                                                   226




           1   water?

           2          A.    Yes, sir.

           3          Q.    And when the boards are removed from

           4   the double culverts as they have been since

           5   approximately 2018, does that affect the ability

           6   of the -- based on your experience in this area,

           7   does that -- does that affect the ability of the

           8   consumptive-use permit holders west of the double

           9   culverts to get their allocation of water?

          10          A.    Yes, sir.

          11          Q.    And why is that?

          12          A.    If you don't stage your water up

          13   higher, then it just doesn't flow into the

          14   property like it needs to.

          15          Q.    Okay.  And based on your years of

          16   experience in working in the Indian Prairie

          17   Basin, is there a certain level of water or

          18   optimal level of water that the L-59 needs to

          19   have west of the double culverts for it to work

          20   for the consumptive-use permit holders?

          21          A.    There's a restriction on how high

          22   the water can be held in the L-59.  It needs to

          23   be held at that height.

          24          Q.    And what is that restriction?

          25          A.    18.5.

                                                                   227




           1          Q.    And during your years of experience

           2   when water is being staged at the double

           3   culverts, is it typically kept at 18.5 west of

           4   the double culverts?

           5          A.    I don't see the reading on a daily

           6   basis.  But I believe we looked at some historic

           7   data and seen that it was there, yes.

           8          Q.    And the water in the L-59 canal,

           9   where does that come from?

          10          A.    It comes from the Indian Prairie

          11   Canal.

          12          Q.    Is that C-40 or what is that?

          13          A.    Yes.

          14          Q.    Okay.  And is there a particular --

          15   is there a permit that is issued that allows

          16   water to be turned from the C-40 or the Indian

          17   Prairie Canal as you call it into the L-59 canal?

          18          A.    There is a permit.

          19          Q.    Is that 1695 permit?  Do you know?

          20          A.    I can't quote the number but that

          21   sounds correct.

          22          Q.    If I can show it to you?

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    Actually this is -- and I'll mark

          25   this as Defendant's 1.  But this is a permit and

                                                                   228




           1   then attached to it is an application.

           2                The 1695 permit?

           3          A.    Yes, sir.

           4          Q.    And have you seen this permit

           5   before?

           6          A.    Yes.

           7          Q.    And to your knowledge is this permit

           8   currently being operated?  Is there a structure

           9   currently being operated by this permit?

          10          A.    I believe so, yes.

          11          Q.    Okay.  And turning to Page Two for

          12   the application for the permit, does that

          13   identify the area proposed to be served by the

          14   permit?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    Okay.  And this identifies the

          17   sections of property that the permit is to serve;

          18   is that correct?

          19          A.    Yes, sir.

          20          Q.    Were you personally involved in the

          21   replacement of the double culverts when that was

          22   done by PV Ranch?

          23          A.    We gave it -- we gave advice on what

          24   the required elevations of the structure are,

          25   maybe a little advice on construction techniques.

                                                                   229




           1          Q.    Okay.  And was there a particular

           2   elevation that the bottom of the culvert should

           3   be at?

           4          A.    Yes.

           5          Q.    And what was that.

           6          A.    I think it's 14.

           7          Q.    Okay.  And why was it 14?

           8          A.    That's roughly the bottom of the

           9   canal but it was a permitted elevation.

          10          Q.    Permitted elevation required by the

          11   District?

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    And why did the District require it

          14   to be at 14?

          15                MR. ESPY:  Objection; calls for

          16          speculation asking him why the District did

          17          something.

          18                THE COURT:  If you can the question

          19          if you know --

          20                MR. JORGENSEN:  I will.

          21   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          22          Q.    Do you know why the District wanted

          23   it at 14 feet?

          24          A.    Not specifically.

          25          Q.    Okay.  Are you familiar with the

                                                                   230




           1   Seminole tribe putting in a structure after the

           2   boards -- the double culverts were removed in

           3   2018?

           4          A.    Yes.

           5          Q.    Okay.  And tell me what you know

           6   about that?

           7          A.    The Seminole tribe placed a --

           8   across L-59 canal as a smaller culvert through.

           9   And they closed it up and held water higher on

          10   the west side.

          11          Q.    And why did they do that to your

          12   knowledge?

          13          A.    The double culvert stopped being

          14   operated.  They weren't able to irrigate their

          15   pastures.

          16          Q.    Mr. Perry, again, based on your work

          17   in the Indian Prairie Basin, are you familiar

          18   with any land owner that may have -- any land

          19   owner east of the double culverts that has a

          20   permit for use of the water in the L-59 canal.

          21          A.    No, I'm not.

          22          Q.    Okay.  We've talked a lot about a

          23   stub canal today.  And it's a stub canal -- let

          24   me ask you this while you're here, Mr. Perry,

          25   this is a -- it appears to be a map that was

                                                                   231




           1   created in 2017.  Did you create this map?

           2          A.    My office did, yes.

           3          Q.    Okay.  Were you involved in that

           4   process?

           5          A.    Yes.

           6                MR. JORGENSEN:  Okay.  This is a

           7          little bit of a cross.  Can I -- if I may

           8          just ask Mr. Espy.  Do you mind --

           9                MR. ESPY:  Oh, easements?

          10                MR. JORGENSEN:  Yeah.

          11                THE COURT:  That's fine.

          12   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          13          Q.    All right.  So who asked you to

          14   prepare this map -- or your company?

          15          A.    It would have been someone from the

          16   Twin Sisters group.

          17          Q.    And when you did this -- when

          18   Johnson and Prewitt did this map or your office

          19   did this map, was it based on a particular

          20   survey.

          21          A.    Yes.

          22                MR. JORGENSEN:  Before I forget, I

          23          need to mark the 1695 permit and

          24          application as Defendants' 1.

          25                THE COURT:  I think you marked it as

                                                                   232




           1          1.

           2                MR. JORGENSEN:  I did?  Okay.

           3   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           4          Q.    All right.  And if I may --

           5   Mr. Perry, if I may approach and show you a

           6   survey prepared by DeHayes and see if you

           7   recognize that to be the survey that you used in

           8   preparation of creation of this map?

           9          A.    Yes, sir.

          10          Q.    And to your knowledge does the map

          11   that you prepared that's on this easel here

          12   accurately reflect how the central easement was

          13   identified in the DeHayes survey?

          14          A.    Yes.

          15          Q.    Okay.  And the date of the DeHayes

          16   survey I believe -- you can look on there and see

          17   yourself but it is -- it's 2001.  Is that the

          18   date of that survey?

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    Are you familiar with the central

          21   easement, Mr. Perry?

          22          A.    Yes.

          23                THE COURT:  Here's a bigger one.

          24                MR. JORGENSEN:  It's driving me

          25          nuts.  Thank you, Judge.

                                                                   233




           1   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           2          Q.    And how are you familiar with the

           3   central easement, Mr. Perry?

           4          A.    Through the work we've done for the

           5   Twin Sisters group.

           6          Q.    And what type of work was that?

           7          A.    We created a map and gave some

           8   advice on where it's located in the --

           9          Q.    And there's a particular section of

          10   the central easement that goes off this section

          11   line; is that correct?

          12          A.    Yes, sir.

          13          Q.    And this route that you drew on this

          14   map which goes at down that Highway 78 at a

          15   slant, does that based on the DeHayes survey?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17                MR. JORGENSEN:  May we move to enter

          18          the DeHayes survey as Defendants' 2.

          19                MR. BREWER:  This is where it gets

          20          weird real quick.  Even though my

          21          coconspirator over here was the one who

          22          took it, I'm doing the easements.  So since

          23          it's up to me whether I object or not,

          24          yeah, I do because of the predicate

          25          involved here.  Which we will get into if

                                                                   234




           1          they, in fact --

           2                THE COURT:  Well, I think what it is

           3          is he's saying that he based that map --

           4                MR. BREWER:  On information --

           5                THE COURT:  -- on that survey.

           6                MR. BREWER:  -- in that survey.

           7                THE COURT:  Yes, correct.

           8                MR. BREWER:  And the information on

           9          that survey was provided by John Austin

          10          Collier and not pursuant to the Judge's

          11          order; and, therefore, we object and

          12          certainly to the predicate.

          13                MR. JORGENSEN:  I disagree but, I

          14          mean, it's based on the -- it's based on

          15          the 1995 stipulation and we can get into

          16          that as we go along here.  But I think in

          17          the pretrial stipulation, we both agreed

          18          that the DeHayes survey and there's another

          19          survey --

          20                THE COURT:  There's another survey.

          21                MR. JORGENSEN:  Both were filed with

          22          the Court so they're competing surveys.

          23                THE COURT:  All right.  I'll

          24          allowed -- I'll allow it in.  I'm not sure

          25          what weight I've give it at this point but

                                                                   235




           1          I'll allow it to be introduced.

           2                What's that -- 2?

           3                MR. JORGENSEN:  2, Defense 2.

           4                THE COURT:  Defense 2.

           5                (Defendant's Exhibit Number 2 was

           6          offered into evidence and received by the

           7          Court.)

           8   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           9          Q.    Anyway I got off track, Mr. Perry.

          10   But are you familiar with a stub canal that would

          11   be up -- I think it's actually shown here on the

          12   map -- that would be off of the L-59 canal up on

          13   the north side of the L-59 canal in Section 16?

          14          A.    I am not.

          15          Q.    Okay.  Thought it was worth a shot.

          16                MR. BREWER:  I'm not sure who should

          17          do the cross.

          18                MR. ESPY:  Do you guys have any?

          19                MR. GLASS:  The District has no

          20          questions.

          21                THE COURT:  Redirect.

          22                MR. ESPY:  Thank you, your Honor.

          23                  REDIRECT EXAMINATION

          24   BY MR. ESPY:

          25          Q.    Did John Austin Collier ask you to

                                                                   236




           1   make that drawing?

           2          A.    Either he or Byron Storey.

           3          Q.    When you submitted the plans for the

           4   new culvert at the double culverts --

           5          A.    Yes, sir?

           6          Q.    -- did you specify a ten-foot riser?

           7          A.    I don't believe we specified the

           8   riser.

           9          Q.    Okay.  A ten-foot riser would be

          10   kind of unusual and impractical?  And by that I

          11   mean it's hard to get the boards in an out when

          12   you have a ten-foot riser?

          13          A.    Yes.  But remember you're standing

          14   on top of a five-foot pipe so it's not as -- it's

          15   not over your head.

          16          Q.    What was the height of the riser

          17   before that -- five foot wide?

          18          A.    I'm not sure that I know.  But it

          19   would have had to be a minimum of five feet, yes.

          20          Q.    Okay.  You don't know -- or do you

          21   know -- if the DeHayes survey was ever filed with

          22   the Court?

          23          A.    I do not know.

          24          Q.    You don't know at all?

          25          A.    No.

                                                                   237




           1          Q.    And do you know if the Leland Dials

           2   survey is filed with the Court?

           3          A.    I do not.

           4          Q.    And you've never compared the two

           5   surveys?

           6          A.    No, I have not.

           7          Q.    So you have no way of knowing how

           8   they differ?

           9          A.    No.

          10          Q.    Permit Number 1695, which is for

          11   the -- up at the -- that one.  I think it's

          12   marked as Defendants' Exhibit 4.

          13          A.    This is not the DeHayes survey.  I

          14   think she has the one that's marked.

          15          Q.    Okay.  Anyway, this is for the

          16   permit for the water enter from L-40 into the --

          17   I mean, C-40 into the L-59?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19          Q.    And this is dated -- this

          20   application for the permit is dated

          21   September 14, 1961, right -- the original

          22   application?

          23          A.    Yes, sir.

          24          Q.    And the permit that was given is

          25   dated February 15, 1962?

                                                                   238




           1          A.    This one says October 9, 1961.

           2          Q.    Well -- I'm sorry.  You're right.

           3   October 9, 1961.  I was looking at the bottom of

           4   the page.

           5                The work was to be completed on or

           6   before February --

           7          A.    Yes.

           8          Q.    -- 15, 1962?

           9                That is before the '62 agreement

          10   that pertains more to the people at the east end

          11   of the --

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    -- L-59?

          14                So at the time this permit was

          15   issued, there had been no consideration given to

          16   what ultimately ended up with the 1962 agreement?

          17          A.    I was born in 1966 so obviously I

          18   wasn't there.  But I am of the opinion that the

          19   Central and Southern Floor Control District was

          20   condemning land to build the L-59 and the C-40

          21   and straighten the Kissimmee River.  And through

          22   that process to protect the Pearce family, there

          23   were certain things that needed to occur and they

          24   were occurring.

          25                Now, ultimately, I think the last

                                                                   239




           1   piece was the double culvert and it came after

           2   the -- so it was -- so I see it listed in the

           3   settlement but the things needed to make it work

           4   they were there.  They weren't listed in the

           5   settlement.

           6          Q.    Okay.  And your answer was much more

           7   artful than my question.

           8                But bottom line is that the

           9   agreement that whereby the double culverts came

          10   into being was entered into after this --

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    -- permit?

          13                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  That's all I have.

          14          Thank you.  Oh, wait a minute.

          15   BY MR. ESPY:

          16          Q.    Do you know whose name Permit 1695

          17   is in today?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19          Q.    Who?

          20          A.    It is in the name of -- it's in

          21   Keith Pearce's ranch name -- and I'm struggling

          22   to say the ranch name -- and then in the name of

          23   Twin Sisters.

          24          Q.    Anybody else?

          25          A.    No, I don't think there's anyone

                                                                   240




           1   else.

           2          Q.    And what was the amount of acreage

           3   that was to be covered by 1695?

           4          A.    I'm not aware.

           5          Q.    Who gave you the information that

           6   it's Twin Sisters?

           7          A.    We applied for permit in that name.

           8   We applied in the name of Twin Sisters.

           9          Q.    And who is Twin Sisters?

          10          A.    Twin Sisters is John Austin.

          11          Q.    Collier?

          12          A.    John Austin Collier, his wife Kim,

          13   Byron Storey and his wife Janet Peeples.

          14          Q.    Okay.  And when did you submit that

          15   application?

          16          A.    I don't recall.  Somewhere in the

          17   2015 time range.

          18                MR. ESPY:  Okay.  All right.  That's

          19          all I have.

          20                THE COURT:  Brief cross?

          21                MR. JORGENSEN:  Direct?

          22                Mr perry, what was --

          23                THE COURT:  Not technically.  That's

          24          his witness.

          25                MR. JORGENSEN:  You're right.  I was

                                                                   241




           1          going call him anyway.  I stand corrected.

           2          I can't recall.

           3                   RECROSS-EXAMINATION

           4   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

           5          Q.    Did you observe the condition of the

           6   double culverts before they were replaced in

           7   2015/2016?

           8          A.    Yes.

           9          Q.    What condition were they in?

          10          A.    Poor.

          11          Q.    Were there boards in the culvert?

          12          A.    Yes.

          13                MR. ESPY:  John, is this your

          14          notebook or notepad?

          15                MR. JORGENSEN:  Yeah.

          16                THE COURT:  Read it before you send

          17          it back.

          18   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          19          Q.    Were the boards holding back any

          20   water?

          21          A.    The culvert had deteriorated to the

          22   point that it wasn't holding water back.

          23          Q.    To your knowledge was the District

          24   requiring that the double culverts be replace4d?

          25          A.    The District did send a letter early

                                                                   242




           1   on in my involvement and -- requesting that --

           2   demanding the culvert be replaced.

           3          Q.    Did the District ever reason why

           4   they were demanding the culvert to be replaced?

           5          A.    Because water was being wasted from

           6   the Basin.

           7          Q.    And based on your years of

           8   experience in working in the Basin, when the

           9   double culverts are in poor condition does the

          10   District complain about it?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    And is that because of the loss of

          13   water?

          14          A.    Yes.

          15          Q.    Okay.  And when you say -- explain

          16   to me why the District has concern about the loss

          17   of water in the Indian Prairie Basin?

          18                MR. ESPY:  Objection; predicate,

          19          speculation.

          20   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          21          Q.    Based on your knowledge in dealings

          22   with the District, can you testify to the Court

          23   why the District is concerned about the loss of

          24   water in the Indian Prairie Basin?

          25                MR. ESPY:  Same objections, your

                                                                   243




           1          Honor.

           2                THE COURT:  If he knows, he can

           3          respond.

           4                THE WITNESS:  The District is

           5          concerned about the conservation of water

           6          throughout the district.  So they would be

           7          concerned with the C-40 basin also.  It's a

           8          little more critical in that it's a fully

           9          allocated basin and there's more concern

          10          about loss there than in other places.

          11          It's one of two places the rules

          12          specifically says it's critically

          13          allocated.

          14   BY MR. JORGENSEN:

          15          Q.    Are you familiar with the compact

          16   with the Seminole tribe?

          17          A.    Yes.

          18          Q.    And is there a particular allocation

          19   of water that the Seminole tribe is to get out of

          20   the Indian Prairie basin?

          21          A.    Yes.

          22          Q.    And what is that percentage?  Do you

          23   know?

          24          A.    I don't remember.

          25          Q.    Okay.  When the boards were removed

                                                                   244




           1   from the -- well, let me ask you this.  Do you

           2   have any knowledge about whether the Seminole

           3   tribe was able to get its allocation of water

           4   from the Indian Prairie Basin once the boards

           5   were removed from the double culverts?

           6          A.    They would not be able to get their

           7   allocation with the boards removed.

           8          Q.    And why is that?

           9          A.    They're on the north side of L-59.

          10   And they're dependent upon the water staging up

          11   into their property.  With the boards removed, it

          12   won't stage up.

          13          Q.    And did the District have any

          14   structure in place back in 2018 to stage water if

          15   water wasn't being staged at the double culverts

          16   that would allow for the Seminole tribe to get

          17   its allocation of water?

          18          A.    No.

          19          Q.    And do you have any knowledge as to

          20   what, if anything, the Seminole tribe did once

          21   the water started flowing through the double

          22   culverts?

          23          A.    After the boards were removed, the

          24   District plugged the -- the Indians plugged the

          25   L-59 canal, there was a small culvert through the

                                                                   245




           1   plug.

           2                MR. JORGENSEN:  All right.  That's

           3          all I have, Mr. Perry.  Thank you.

          12                MR. ESPY:  Your Honor, could we

          13          request a brief recess at this point?

          14                THE COURT:  Recess is one of my

          15          better subjects in school.  Sure.
