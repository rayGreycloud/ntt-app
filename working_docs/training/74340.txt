ðŸš©\n 
      7                  THE REPORTER:  We are on record at 1:59 p.m.

      8                  Mr. Li, can you please raise your right hand

      9        for me.  Perfect.

     10                  Do you affirm under the penalty of perjury

     11        that the testimony you are about to give will be the

     12        truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

     13                  THE DEPONENT:  Yes.

     14                  THE REPORTER:  Thank you.

     15                  Will each attorney please state their name and

     16        whom they represent.

     17                  MR. MAACK:  Tony Maack representing defendant

     18        Vannostern.

     19                  MR. PURCELL:  Tom Purcell also representing

     20        defendant Vannostern.

     21                  MR. GREGG:  Robert Greg representing

     22        plaintiff, SiPing Li.

     23                  THE REPORTER:  Thank you.

     24                  Counsel, please proceed.

     25        SIPING LI, having been first duly affirmed to tell the


                                                                      5


      1        truth, was examined, and testified as follows:

      2        EXAMINATION

      3        BY MR. MAACK:

      4             Q.   Mr. Li, I'm going to be asking you questions

      5        today.  I'm going to have you start off by just stating

      6        and spelling your full name for the record.

      7             A.   Yes.  First name is SiPing, S-I-P-I-N-G.  Last

      8        name Li, L-I.

      9             Q.   And do you have a middle name?

     10             A.   No.

     11             Q.   Okay.  Have you ever had your deposition taken

     12        before?

     13             A.   No.

     14             Q.   Okay.  I'm just going to lay out a few ground

     15        rules for today's deposition.  It is my opportunity and

     16        Mr. Purcell's opportunity to ask you questions about a

     17        car accident that occurred on September 1st, 2020.  This

     18        is not a -- supposed to be a marathon or an opportunity

     19        for us to trick you.  We're just trying to get the best

     20        information about your situation from the accident.

     21                  One of the most important things with the

     22        deposition is that you listen to my questions before you

     23        respond.  And you're doing a good job with that so far.

     24        We don't want to talk over each other even if you can

     25        anticipate the question and your response.


                                                                      6


      1                  I don't want you to guess to anything that you

      2        don't know, but if you're able to provide your best

      3        estimate, then I'd ask you to do so.

      4                  It's also important that you give audible

      5        responses rather than pointing a part of your body or

      6        making a gesture with your head just so it's picked up

      7        on the court reporter's transcript because the court

      8        reporter's taking down everything that you say, my

      9        questions, any objections your attorney might have.

     10        Okay?

     11             A.   Yes.

     12             Q.   I'm going to try my best to ask questions

     13        efficiently.  Usually what I try to do is take a break

     14        on the hour, but if you need to take a break at any

     15        time, just let me know.  I'm happy to accommodate that.

     16        The only courtesy I'd ask from you is if there's a

     17        question pending that you respond first before we take

     18        that break.  Is that fair?

     19             A.   Yes.

     20             Q.   Okay.  In preparation for today's deposition,

     21        did you review any documents?

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   What documents did you do to -- review to

     24        prepare for today's deposition?

     25             A.   The biggest one the -- my medical record.


                                                                      7


      1             Q.   Okay.  Did you review all your medical records

      2        or just select records?

      3             A.   From beginning to end, looked at every the

      4        title in the app, MyChart app, but for some, I go into

      5        there, see the detail for the --

      6             Q.   Okay.

      7             A.   -- key point, key point, yeah.

      8             Q.   Okay.  So I understand that you reviewed your

      9        medical records off your MyChart app; is that correct?

     10             A.   Yes.

     11             Q.   Okay.  And when you say beginning, what does

     12        that mean as far as time goes?  In other words, is there

     13        a certain year you started off with?

     14             A.   I would say there are two beginnings.  One

     15        beginning is the September 1st, 2020, the onset of the

     16        incident, accident.

     17             Q.   Uh-huh.

     18             A.   The other one is before that, since 20 -- 2019

     19        or 2018.  2019.  I think 2018.  Actually that's MyChart,

     20        beginning of MyChart in my hospital Providence health

     21        care.

     22             Q.   Okay.  So from what I understand of your

     23        testimony, the first beginning would be the date of this

     24        car accident --

     25             A.   Uh-huh.


                                                                      8


      1             Q.   -- to present day; is that correct?

      2             A.   Correct.

      3             Q.   Okay.  And the second beginning would be

      4        approximately 2018 up until the date of the car

      5        accident?

      6             A.   Correct.

      7             Q.   Okay.  In terms of the second beginning

      8        starting in 2018, were all the medical records you

      9        reviewed from Providence?

     10             A.   Yes, correct.

     11             Q.   In other words, there weren't other -- other

     12        medical providers outside of the Providence system in

     13        the records review from 2018 to the date of the

     14        accident; is that correct?

     15             A.   Sorry.  I didn't get that.  Can you --

     16             Q.   That's a -- that's a good way to respond.

     17                  What I'm just trying to clarify is that there

     18        were no other medical providers besides the Providence

     19        medical system providers from 2018 up until the date of

     20        the accident in the records you reviewed?

     21             A.   Let me think.  I will say yes, but the --

     22        there is some other provider even -- they are not

     23        Providence doctor, but they are -- no, sorry, in day,

     24        the admission in day, Providence is like other doctor

     25        referred by my concussion specialist, they -- like


                                                                      9


      1        Dr. Stone for the New XX eye kind of treatment.

      2             Q.   It's my understanding that you began seeing

      3        Dr. Stone after the accident; is that correct?

      4             A.   Of course.

      5             Q.   Okay.  Besides your medical records, did you

      6        review any other documents in preparation for your

      7        deposition today?

      8             A.   I review document from the law office of

      9        Mr. Gregg.

     10             Q.   Okay.  And I don't want to hear anything about

     11        privileged information or communications between you and

     12        your attorney.

     13             A.   Uh-huh.

     14             Q.   Did you review any photographs in preparation

     15        for your deposition?

     16             A.   No.

     17             Q.   Okay.  Did you review your responses to

     18        interrogatories and requests for production?

     19             A.   What's an interraugust [sic] and the

     20        reproduction?

     21                  MR. MAACK:  I'll just -- if I can make this

     22        Exhibit 1.

     23                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 1 was marked for

     24        identification.)

     25                  MR. GREGG:  Thank you, Counsel.


                                                                     10


      1                  MR. MAACK:  I'll just make a stack.

      2                  THE DEPONENT:  Sorry, I didn't.

      3        BY MR. MAACK:

      4             Q.   I'll re-ask the question.  I've handed you a

      5        document that's entitled Defendant's First

      6        Interrogatories and Requests for Production to

      7        Plaintiff.

      8                  Have you reviewed this document before?

      9             A.   I think so.  I think probably earlier.  Year

     10        ago or sometime, right?  So -- so that's why I am not

     11        sure.  The -- because I remember I see the -- this

     12        somewhere -- the -- I'm sorry -- this among here, I saw

     13        some question, answer, number -- I think I have viewed

     14        this before.

     15             Q.   Okay.  And this was not a document that you

     16        reviewed in preparation for your deposition.  You

     17        reviewed this a year ago by your memory; is that

     18        correct?

     19             A.   Yes.  Correct.

     20             Q.   Okay.  Have you taken any medications within

     21        the last 24 hours?

     22             A.   No.

     23             Q.   Do you have any medical condition that could

     24        affect your ability to recall the events surrounding the

     25        car accident or understand my questions?


                                                                     11


      1             A.   Not at the moment.  There is a tendency, if

      2        the setback, my XX will come back, it may affect my

      3        understanding because I will got dizzy and the foggy.

      4        So far, I'm good.

      5             Q.   Okay.  Have you been involved in any other

     15        parents was one of the reasons for retiring.

     16             A.   Uh-huh.

     17             Q.   Did you have other reasons that you wanted to

     18        retire at age 62?

     19             A.   Well, of course, enjoy life, and hiking

     20        around, and we -- first time we go back, we climbed a

     21        couple mountain there.

     22             Q.   Tell me about your fitness level before the

     23        accident in your own words.

     24             A.   In my own words?

     25             Q.   Uh-huh.


                                                                     21


      1             A.   I was super XX -- as I said, climbed the South

      2        Sister 2019, October.  So that's a few month before the

      3        2020 September accident.  That's six miles, about 9,000

      4        some feet or 8,000 feet, the elevation XX.  I reach

      5        there in four and a half hours.

      6                  We have team of over ten people, and I am the

      7        second one after 16 years old, a young girl.  She's

      8        athlete.  So I'm celebrity in my local hiking, yeah,

      9        community.

     10                  I -- I would say I reviewed my medical records

     11        since 2018.  Wow.  I'm a cancer survivor.  I have a

     12        tumor in my left kidney.

     13             Q.   Uh-huh.

     14             A.   Kidney's removed, and 2018 -- I believe I

     15        should say so much.  Is okay I'm keep talking?

     16             Q.   I'll ask a follow-up question.  You mentioned

     17        that you have a hiking group or you had a hiking group?

     18             A.   Yes.

     19             Q.   Who were the members of that hiking group?

     20             A.   I know who it are in the hiking group, but

     21        it's hard to say who they are.  It's in the WeChat

     22        group.  It's the -- everyone using their username.  I

     23        will not use SiPing.  I use my username Xing Zhe.  So I

     24        know who they are.  We met there.

     25                  May I continue my question on the -- my cancer


                                                                     22


      1        and then I go to the hiking?

      2             Q.   Sure.  That's fine.

      3             A.   Okay.  So 2018, that's, you know, after

      4        retirement, I -- Xiaohua and XX travel in Hong Kong, I

      5        didn't have any family doctor and didn't go to doctor

      6        for two years.  Then as I happen to be XX a survivor

      7        today is one of a million chance.

      8                  They -- one person posted a message your

      9        garden group.  She posted only once.  She said:  In our

     10        lab, we need a volunteer for ultrasound.  And I happened

     11        to see that message.  And, also, the lab, OTI, Oregon

     12        Technology Institute, in the big lake, next to the big

     13        lake, that's best places for bird watching in the

     14        springtime to get '18.  So I decided to go.

     15                  That's fun.  Also, I -- major was PE.  I know

     16        the bone and muscles so I like to see my -- see inside.

     17        So I did.  And what they happened --

     18             Q.   I don't want to --

     19             A.   Too much.

     20             Q.   -- get -- get you into a narrative too much.

     21             A.   Okay.

     22             Q.   So it's my understanding in 2018 you didn't

     23        have a family doctor, and someone volunteered to allow

     24        you to go under an ultrasound?

     25             A.   Yeah.


                                                                     23


      1             Q.   Okay.  And after undergoing the ultrasound,

      2        they discovered a tumor.  Is it on your kidney?

      3             A.   Correct.

      4             Q.   Okay.

      5             A.   Six centimeter long.  Then I -- hurry, you

      6        know, hurry, find my family doctor, new to her.  That's

      7        2018.  So Katy is my family doctor.  That's my -- found

      8        the correct.  Let's do it.  I got cancer.

      9                  So June 2018 did the surgery.  Kidney removed.

     10        I was very energetic before that moment.  I were hiking

     11        around with my team.  I'm strongest person in the whole

     12        team.  If they go one way six miles, I go with them.

     13        They park car on the other side.  I round -- I do

     14        roundtrip, 12 miles.  I run.  They walk.

     15                  And after surgery, I'm still that to-go

     16        person.  I begin to recover.  Within first week, I

     17        already walking.

     18             Q.   Can I stop you real quick?

     19             A.   Yeah.

     20             Q.   When you say I'm that to-go person, what does

     21        that mean?

     22             A.   Well, that's the -- speech therapist Beverly

     23        told me:  You are a goer, which means you got thing you

     24        want to get it, too.  You just want to do it.  That's

     25        what she told me.  I didn't realize that until she told


                                                                     24


      1        me.

      2                  So after surgery, I begin to recover, already

      3        walking miles in the first week.  Within two weeks, I

      4        walked six miles a day but very slowly, hold my belly.

      5        And in the -- that's 2019 -- 2018 June surgery.

      6                  2019, March, I was on peak of Mount Saint

      7        Helens.  That's 12-mile roundtrip, about six or some

      8        thousand feet.  Again, my -- my hiking shocked my hiking

      9        community.

     10             Q.   Before the accident, how many mountains did --

     11        have you climbed?

     12             A.   I cannot count.  There're too many.  Not only

     13        here in Washington, Oregon, in China.  There are many.

     14        California.

     15             Q.   Since 2018 up until the accident, how many

     16        mountains did you climb?

     17             A.   From 2018 to the accident?

     18             Q.   Correct.

     19             A.   2018, not saying reach the peak, I have that

     20        count if you're just hiking through the mountain, that's

     21        a lot.  But reaching to the peak, I did Mount Saint

     22        Helen, yes, Mount Saint Helen three times.  The first

     23        time after the surgery was in, as I said, in March 2019.

     24        It's noted in my family doctor chart as merely nine

     25        weeks after surgery.  And I did Mount Adams twice.  I


                                                                     25


      1        summited once.  I went to Sister twice.  I summited

      2        there.  And the others is hiking, too, with the group or

      3        myself, Broken Top and the Mount Jefferson and the

      4        mountain in the Washington.

      5                  Let's go.  I cannot remember how many have

      6        been there, I've been to China for two big mountains.

      7             Q.   And that's since 2018?

      8             A.   Yeah.  First, 2018.

      9             Q.   And I just want to clarify some of the dates.

     10        You mentioned that you climbed Mount Saint Helen's nine

     11        weeks after the surgery; is that correct?

     12             A.   Correct.

     13             Q.   Okay.  And the surgery for removing the -- the

     14        kidney mass was in June of 2018; is that right?

     15             A.   June 2018, yes.

     16             Q.   Okay.  So is it your testimony that you were

     17        able to climb Mount Saint Helen's as of September or

     18        October of 2018?

     19             A.   No.  Climbing Saint Helen, March 2019.

     20             Q.   Okay.

     21             A.   Nine month after my kidney removed.

     22             Q.   Oh.  Thank you for clarifying that.  I think I

     23        heard weeks and not months.

     24                  What -- was there a rehabilitation plan

     25        provided to you after you had kidney surgery?


                                                                     26


      1             A.   Actually, not.

      2             Q.   Okay.

      3             A.   But I search, you know.  That's strange.  I

      4        don't know why.

      5             Q.   How would -- how would you describe your state

      6        of health after you had kidney surgery?

      7             A.   How do I?

      8             Q.   How did you feel after you had kidney surgery?

      9             A.   Initially, it is a pain on the -- on the belly

     10        from the surgery.  Otherwise, I don't feel I'm weak

     11        because before the surgery, I was super strong, even

     12        within the -- just a couple days before the surgery, I'm

     13        still hiking with my group.  So I think it was just

     14        cutting this.  This, it doesn't bother me -- bother me.

     15        I will be back on my feet quickly.  And I did.

     16             Q.   Okay.  So before the surgery, you were super

     17        strong, in your own words?

     18             A.   Yes.

     19             Q.   Okay.  When after the surgery did you get back

     20        to a point where you felt strong enough to hike at the

     21        level you were before the surgery?

     22             A.   Of course, nine month after I was on Mount

     23        Saint Helen.

     24             Q.   Okay.  So nine months?

     25             A.   Yeah.


                                                                     27


      1             Q.   Okay.

      2             A.   Yeah, just that this is true in 2018.  That's

      3        March 2019.  My family doctor, Katy, took notes in 2019

      4        August well my -- wellness checkup visit.  She mentioned

      5        that I climbed Mount Saint Helen in March 2019, and,

      6        also, I climbed Mount King Adams twice in July 2019.

      7        That's in the chart.

      8             Q.   Okay.  When you hiked, did you have a fitness

      9        watch?

     10             A.   I don't remember I wear one.

     11             Q.   And when I say a fitness watch, I mean an

     12        Apple watch or a Garmin.  You understand that, correct?

     13             A.   I understand, and I do have.

     14             Q.   Okay.  How long have you had a fitness watch?

     15             A.   Many years, many, ten, over -- over ten years.

     16                  MR. GREGG:  I didn't hear that.

     17                  THE DEPONENT:  Over ten years, I have my

     18        fitness watch.

     19                  MR. GREGG:  Thank you.

     20        BY MR. MAACK:

     21             Q.   When you hike or do physical activities, do

     22        you download data from your fitness watch onto a

     23        computer software like Garmin or Strava, something to

     24        that effect?

     25             A.   I do.


                                                                     28


      1             Q.   What -- what applications do you use to

      2        download your fitness data?

      3             A.   I use -- tried several ones like -- gosh, I

      4        forgot the name.  If you mention couple, probably I can

      5        remember.

      6             Q.   You're putting me on the spot.  I'm aware of

      7        Garmin, Strava.

      8             A.   No.

      9             Q.   Map My Run?

     10             A.   No.  Not Strava.

     11             Q.   Apple Health?

     12             A.   No, I'm sorry, but I did try a few of them.  I

     13        did try, yeah.

     14             Q.   Okay.  Do you remember what type of watch,

     15        fitness watch, you had?

     16             A.   Oh, I have the Garmin.

     17             Q.   Do you still have that watch?

     18             A.   I still have that watch.

     19             Q.   Okay.  You've referenced hiking Mount Saint

     20        Helen's in March of 2019.  Do you recall who you hiked

     21        the mountain with?

     22             A.   I hiked solo.

     23             Q.   You mentioned hiking Mount Adams.  Do you

     24        recall who you hiked that mountain with?

     25             A.   Solo hiking.


                                                                     29


      1             Q.   When you hiked Sisters, did you hike it with

      2        anyone else, or did you do that solo?

      3             A.   That one with the whole team, about ten

      4        people.

      5             Q.   Okay.  Was your wife part of the team?

      6             A.   I have explain that.  The team is not strict

      7        organized team, who is in the team, who is not.  Team is

      8        a social group.  It's called Hikers like for example.

      9                  So if you are in the team, well, there are 500

     10        people in the group, but, you know, someone come here to

     11        go today, so you are in the team.  If you not go today,

     12        you are not in the team.

     13             Q.   Okay.

     14             A.   For some of it.  There are other parts of

     15        other group, and they kick you out if you do not

     16        participate.  I was kicked out by one group.

     17             Q.   You were kicked out of the group?

     18             A.   Yeah, because I got sick.  And then I'm not

     19        participating.  They kick me out even though I'm pretty

     20        good at it.  But at that time, they don't know.

     21             Q.   Did they -- when you say kicked out, did they

     22        stop communicating with you, or did you just not

     23        participate because you couldn't?

     24             A.   They remove you out of the group.

     25             Q.   Okay.  How did you find this group in the


                                                                     30


      1        first place?

      2             A.   My mouth, by mouth.  Mouth, by mouth.

      3             Q.   By mouth?

      4             A.   Yeah.

      5             Q.   Since you had the kidney surgery in 2018, was

      6        the Sisters hike the only hike you did with other

      7        people?

      8             A.   No.

      9             Q.   What other hikes have you done with other

     10        people beside Sisters?

     11             A.   I think there's one through Mount Jefferson,

     12        yeah.

     13             Q.   And who did you hike Mount Jefferson with?

     14             A.   A different hiking group.  Again, it's in

     15        WeChat group.  Everybody use username.  I know some of

     16        them, the real name, and I still communicate with them

     17        often, but I cannot say who are they, where do they

     18        live.  Some, I know.  You know, what's a real name, I

     19        don't know.  We meet together.  We call by username.

     20             Q.   Okay.  Besides hiking, what other fitness

     21        activities did you participate in from June 2018 up

     22        until the point of the accident, if any?

     23             A.   From what time to what time?

     24             Q.   So the time frame I'm asking about is when you

     25        had the kidney surgery up until the date of the


                                                                     31


      1        accident, so roughly a year and a half.

      2             A.   Oh.

      3             Q.   Maybe more, two and a half years.

      4             A.   Like swim, jogging, running, hiking, biking.

      5             Q.   How often did you swim?

      6             A.   Mainly in summer or sometime I go to the gym

      7        so not very often.

      8             Q.   What gym are you a member of?

      9             A.   I don't have gym member.  I go to the Tualatin

     10        XX Health Center.  It's public.

     11             Q.   The public pool in Tualatin?

     12             A.   Yeah.

     13             Q.   Okay.  How often were you running or jogging?

     14             A.   But since the injury, of course, it's not

     15        daily, but that's my goal.  I -- since week -- weekly at

     16        least five times, especially when I getting better.  So

     17        you'll see me after the surgery, yeah, that's at least

     18        five times.

     19             Q.   Okay.  And just so I'm clear, you're saying

     20        you're running at least five times a week after the 2018

     21        surgery up until the point of the accident; is that

     22        right?

     23             A.   Yeah.

     24             Q.   What distance would you run?

     25             A.   I run five miles, six miles, kind of


                                                                     32


      1        regularly, slow run, and sometimes I run ten miles.

      2             Q.   Did you participate in any sort of organized

      3        race activities?

      4             A.   What activities?

      5             Q.   Like an organized race activity?

      6             A.   Ever or?

      7             Q.   Within that time period?

      8             A.   No.

      9             Q.   Okay.  Did you track your distance or speed

     10        with the fitness watch?

     11             A.   Sometimes, yes.

     12             Q.   And that would be the same Garmin watch you

     13        were using before?

     14             A.   Yes.

     15             Q.   Okay.  Does your Garmin watch have a heart

     16        rate monitor?

     17             A.   Yes.

     18             Q.   Do you have a separate heart rate monitor that

     19        you would wear when you would exercise?

     20             A.   No, but I need to explain the Garmin heart

     21        rate monitor.  That's old one.  That's a separate strap

     22        so I usually do not wear it.  So Garmin does not know my

     23        heart rate.

     24             Q.   Okay.  I didn't really understand your

     25        response.


                                                                     33


      1             A.   The old Garmin watch, if you want to watch --

      2        monitor your heart rate, you need the strap on your

      3        chest.  You do not wear it, the watch does not know your

      4        heart rate.

      5             Q.   Okay.  And you didn't have one of those

      6        straps; is that right?

      7             A.   I have.

      8             Q.   You do?

      9             A.   I just do not wear it because, you know, you

     10        have to next to your skin.  It's not convenient.  I do

     11        not use that anymore.

     12             Q.   Okay.  Between these activities we talked

     13        about, hiking, running, swimming, I believe you also

     14        mentioned biking, did your wife participate in any of

     15        them with you?

     16             A.   Yes.

     17             Q.   Which activities?

     18             A.   Oh, like the 2020 -- I'm sorry.  Might be

     19        hard, kind of fatigued, tired.  So actually in 2020, so

     20        say 2021 -- 2019 to 2020, before the accident, that's

     21        COVID period, we have to access local so every week,

     22        actually every day, I would try to push her together

     23        with me ride a bike to a local park because school, like

     24        school, the track field, it's softer.  It's closed.  We

     25        go to that park each day if possible if she want to.


                                                                     34


      1                  As I said, at least five days a week we go

      2        there.  Run, jogging, not jogging like if you on a

      3        track.  My distance with Garmin is -- may not accurate

      4        because I run, not with a high intensity interval

      5        training, HIIT, there.  I run probably 80 meters XX.  I

      6        don't know the exact or the short run, 50 meter and dash

      7        as fast as I can, go there, spend a minute or two rest,

      8        heart rate down, walk back from beginning, dash again.

      9        I don't know how they -- how the Garmin record it.  The

     10        Garmin will warn you, too fast, too fast, slow down,

     11        slow down.

     12             Q.   When did you begin doing the high intensity

     13        interval training?

     14             A.   Probably five years before the accident when I

     15        learned that such exercises.

     16             Q.   Was it -- did you learn how to do the

     17        exercises through a class or on your own?

     18             A.   On my own.  I'm PE teacher.

     19                  MR. MAACK:  Do you want to take a break?

     20                  MR. GREGG:  Sure.

     21                  THE DEPONENT:  Yes.

     24                  MR. MAACK:  How long do you need?

                                                                     35


      1                  MR. MAACK:  That's fine.

      2                  THE DEPONENT:  Thank you.

      8        BY MR. MAACK:

      9             Q.   All right.  Mr. Li, one more question about

     10        your hiking history.  In Exhibit 1, the interrogatories,

     11        you mentioned an individual named Zhen Yang as your

     12        hiking partner?

     13             A.   Yes.

     14             Q.   What's your relation with Ms. Yang?

     15             A.   Just a hiker.

     16             Q.   Okay.  And does Ms. Yang have an understanding

     17        of your condition both before and after the accident?

     18             A.   I say yes or no.  Does not quite fully

     19        describe the situation.

     20             Q.   Okay.  How would you describe the situation?

     21             A.   She know me.  I'm kind of local celebrity of

     22        the hikers, mount hikers, and after the injury, she only

     23        know what I told her.  I didn't tell her much.

     24             Q.   Okay.  When's the last time you have spoken

     25        with her?


                                                                     36


      1             A.   Several month ago.

      2             Q.   That would be in the year 2023?

      3             A.   Maybe in '23.  I'm not sure.

      4             Q.   Do you think it would be sooner than that or

      5        later than that?

      6             A.   I'm not sure.  We do not communicate often

      7        especially when I cannot hike anymore.

      8             Q.   I promised that was my last question, but I

      9        have another one.  You describe yourself as a local

     10        celebrity.

     11                  In your own words, why do you believe you're

     12        considered a local celebrity in the hiking community?

     13             A.   Well, see, back to that kidney surgery, nine

     14        month after kidney surgery, March 2019, I was on top of

     15        South Sister -- excuse me -- no, Mount Saint Helen.  And

     16        before I'm going up, there's something happened, a hiker

     17        -- a hiking leader from XX, they organize this team.

     18        Many I knew to the second hiking.  They go up to the

     19        Mount Saint Helen.  So a lot of people know how hard it

     20        is.  It is not summer route.  It's winter route, much

     21        longer, much harder.

     22                  And after that, two of the hikers of our team

     23        was missing in the Mount Saint Helen.  They were rescued

     24        the next day.  So that was reporting in the news report.

     25        And then our team lead had the hikers in community


                                                                     37


      1        meeting and talk about the accident and they said don't

      2        do solo hiking.  Do not go by yourself.  But that

      3        meeting, they already decided the day before I wanted to

      4        go hike.  So actually I just go next day.

      5                  I go there solo.  When I came back, they know,

      6        the whole community's wow, wow.  That's a lot of tons,

      7        tons of messages came in the chat, WeChat group saying,

      8        wow, you did that.  That's so great.

      9                  And then later at a party, my friend had a

     10        party, and my friend introduce me to other, and that guy

     11        said, oh, wow I see a celebrity.  Shake my hand.  And a

     12        few other people, also, wow, you are the -- my username,

     13        say, oh, you are the Xing Zhe.

     14                  And if you need I can --

     15                  THE REPORTER:  Yes, please.

     16                  THE DEPONENT:  Xing Zhe is a Chinese word.

     17        It's pronounce it Asian.  It's X-I-N-G Z-H-E.  That's my

     18        username but in Chinese.  So -- so everybody know me.

     19        They just think you are so great.

     20        BY MR. MAACK:

     21             Q.   So it was from this one incident that you just

     22        described is when you became a local celebrity, is that

     23        kind of the summary?

     24             A.   I think so.

     25             Q.   Okay.


                                                                     38


      1             A.   I don't want to say that.  I just -- I'm kind

      2        of private.  I do not want --

      3             Q.   Okay.

      4             A.   Excuse me.  I get my water.

      5                  Also, when they do the hike, sometimes I do

      6        extra.  Like I said, they go six mile one way.  One way,

      7        they need to park car on the other end.  I just follow

      8        the car to the other side.  I run back and go back.  I

      9        do that quite a bit with them, with the team.

     10             Q.   I'm going to ask you a few more questions

     12                  MR. MAACK:  Mark this as Exhibit 2.

     13                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 2 was marked for

     14        identification.)

     15        BY MR. MAACK:

     16             Q.   So, Mr. Li, you can see that this is a

     17        physical therapy record of yours from November 6, 2018.

     18        Did you review this record?

     19             A.   Let me read it.

     20             Q.   Sure.

     21             A.   Kelly Powers, 2018.  That's before the

     22        accident so November, 11.  I did not read this in --

     23        before the deposition.

     24             Q.   Okay.

     25             A.   But I did, like I said, I go through.  I know


                                                                     39


      1        this therapist.  She treated me.  She's team lead.  I

      2        like her very much.

      3             Q.   Okay.  So my first question is:  This record

      4        references a 40-year history of upper back pain.

      5             A.   Correct.

      6             Q.   And that was what you described to the

      7        physical therapist; is that correct?

      8             A.   Correct.

      9             Q.   Okay.  Tell me about your 40-year history of

     10        upper back pain.

     11             A.   Sure.  At about age 20, again, I was healthy.

     12        I was a PE teacher, and I don't have the upper back

     13        pain.  After sunny day basketball game, I ride bikes

     14        through underground bridge.  When I got up the other

     15        side, sitting there was T XX, the rain -- raindrops

     16        behind me from the youth like rain curtain, and the cold

     17        wind blow through the XX, and I think I got that cold

     18        thing.

     19                  I just -- somehow my upper back pain.  I

     20        cannot get up for a couple of weeks.  And from that

     21        point, when I was 20, age 20, I got back pain problem.

     22             Q.   Okay.  The back pain has continued since age

     23        20?

     24             A.   Correct.

     25             Q.   Okay.  And when you say upper back pain, is


                                                                     40


      1        the location above or below your shoulder blade area?

      2             A.   Above the shoulder blade area.

      3             Q.   Is it in the middle of the back on your spine?

      4             A.   No.  Not -- sorry.  I have to be clear.  The

      5        upper back area is beyond the middle muscle soreness.

      6             Q.   Okay.  So when you're describing the area of

      7        pain, how would you describe it to me in your own words

      8        when you experience that upper back pain?

      9             A.   Oh, I do not -- it's sore.  That's the word.

     10        I'm not -- when you say pain, I think of pain kind of

     11        more sharp, more acute.  Once it's sore, it's like even

     12        you have done some hard work, your muscle gotten sore,

     13        that kind of pain, sore.  It's sore.  Even now.

     14             Q.   Okay.  Well, soreness or pain, whatever we

     15        want to call it, where -- where do you experience that

     16        pain on your upper back?  Is it between -- is it below

     17        your neck and above your shoulder blades?

     18             A.   It's below my neck and above my lower -- from

     19        middle of my body up.

     20             Q.   Okay.  Do you still experience that same pain

     21        or soreness sensation to this day?

     22             A.   Yes, I do.

     23             Q.   How often do you experience --

     24             A.   I'm sorry.  Just a minute.  The therapist

     25        Kelly, I ask her particularly, this pain because


                                                                     41


      1        bothering me for many, many years.  I said I won't get

      2        this one cured.  She really -- she kind of push it back.

      3        She didn't -- she didn't promise me, but she prescribed

      4        me the roller, and I practice it.  And the one day, it

      5        disappeared.  I went.  I told her.

      6                  I don't know if she wrote in chart, but the

      7        back pain was gone.  And it was gone for about two

      8        years.  And it's only come back -- it's come back after

      9        the car -- car accident because I -- I cannot do that

     10        much exercises anymore and also got depressed.  I don't

     11        do it.

     12             Q.   I'm going to refer you back to this Exhibit 2.

     13             A.   Yeah.

     14             Q.   Do you agree that on November 6, 2018 you had

     15        a physical therapy appointment for upper back pain and

     16        chronic pain in both of your knees?

     17             A.   Yes.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Did you read down under the section

     19        that says clinical impressions, and I want to refer you

     20        to the middle of that section.  It says he has kidney

     21        cancer, and nephrectomy performed 6-20-18, and has not

     22        done much exercise over the last four months with

     23        increase in pain noted.

     24             A.   Kidney cancer and nephrectomy performed, not

     25        done much exercise over last four month with increase in


                                                                     42


      1        pain noted.  When this happened?  This is November 2018.

      2             Q.   My question for you is if you agree with that

      3        statement that for the last four months, from the date

      4        of your surgery until November, hadn't done much

      5        exercise?

      6             A.   Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

      7             Q.   Okay.

      8             A.   Yeah, of course, I think so I'm counting like

      9        June.  That's less than five months so, see, it's four

     10        months.  Of course, I don't think I did much because the

     11        surgery.  I can walk but very slowly.  I walk a lot.  I

     12        said within weeks, I walk six miles, but very, very

     13        slow.

     14             Q.   Do you recall the reason why you requested

     15        physical therapy in November of 2018?

     16             A.   Oh, yes.  That's -- the real reason is because

     17        I was very healthy before I find -- I found my kidney

     18        issues.  I do annual wellness check and physical exam

     19        annually.  I do each year.  I'm so healthy my doctor

     20        told me, he said, don't come next year.  Go another

     21        year.  You every two years, but I still go every year.

     22                  However, as I said, 2016, I retired, and my

     23        insurance had changed.  So I without the doctor for

     24        about two years.  And then all of a sudden, it's just --

     25        just happened to find a kidney cancer here that almost


                                                                     43


      1        killed me.  I know other people died from this XX

      2        because they do not check this in the annual exam.  And

      3        they -- one way they found it is XX has died.

      4                  And so after I did my surgery, where I was

      5        thinking there might be something else hidden in my

      6        body.  So I went to my family doctor after the surgery,

      7        several month later, I think this now in November

      8        probably, yes, about that time.

      9                  So I went to make doctor check me, everything,

     10        whatsoever, every part.  She just checked my -- my knee

     11        pain, my elbow pain, my back pain, lower back, upper

     12        back, finger, checked everything.  So I did all this.

     13        Fortunately, they didn't find anything serious.

     14             Q.   So are you saying that you had knee pain,

     15        upper back pain.  Did you also have lower back pain, as

     16        well?

     17             A.   I did.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Who -- what was the name of your

     19        primary care doctor that you spoke with and referred you

     20        to physical therapy?

     21             A.   I can remember her first name, Katy.

     22             Q.   Okay.

     23             A.   K-A-T-Y.

     24             Q.   What branch of Providence was Katy with?

     25             A.   Providence health care, Bethany Clinic.


                                                                     44


      1             Q.   Okay.  Do you still have knee pain now?

      2             A.   Yes.

      3             Q.   Is it pain in both knees?

      4             A.   Mainly right knee.

      5             Q.   Okay.  Have you received any treatment for

      6        pain in your right or left knee since the car accident?

      7             A.   No.

      8             Q.   Does it prevent you from doing activities?

      9             A.   No, not really.  It's noted in my chart.  When

     10        I'm hiking, there's no problem.

     11                  MR. MAACK:  I'm going to mark this as Exhibit

     12        3.

     13                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 3 was marked for

     14        identification.)

     15        BY MR. MAACK:

     16             Q.   And I'm just going to refer you to the first

     17        page of Exhibit 3.  This is a medical chart note from

     18        August 1st, 2019, Mr. Li.

     19             A.   Okay.  I cannot see who.  Bethany.  Who is a

     20        provider here?  Janoff, followed.

     21             Q.   Was this one of the records you reviewed in

     22        preparation for your deposition today?

     23             A.   I don't think so.

     24             Q.   Okay.  I just have a few quick questions off

     25        Exhibit 3.  If you look down towards the bottom of the


                                                                     45


      1        first page, it references ear issues.

      2             A.   Uh-huh.

      3             Q.   Do you see that?

      4             A.   Yes.

      5             Q.   Okay.  And the record says tinnitus, off and

      6        on, both ears, almost always there, gone for a few

      7        minutes at a time.

      8                  Okay.  And I just want you to confirm that I

      9        read that correctly based on what the medical record

     10        says?

     11             A.   I have to say yes because I do not remember,

     12        and if you have this here printed, I believe is correct

     13        information you got from my chart.

     14             Q.   Okay.  Do you recall having ear issues or a

     15        ringing pain in your ears in August of 2019?

     16             A.   Okay.  2019.  I'm not sure the exact time, but

     17        I know I complained to my family doctor, Katy, that I

     18        have ear ring.

     19             Q.   Okay.  When you had an ear ring, was it in one

     20        ear or both ears, from what you can recall?

     21             A.   I'm not sure.

     22             Q.   Okay.  How often did you have ear rings in

     23        2019?

     24             A.   As I remember is quite often.

     25             Q.   Okay.  Did you continue to have ear rings


                                                                     46


      1        after the accident happened?

      2             A.   It's still there.

      3             Q.   It's still there as of today?

      4             A.   Yes.

      5             Q.   Which ear is it in?  Left, right, or both?

      6             A.   Yeah, as I said, I didn't remember did I

      7        complain one ear or complain of right ear.  But I know

      8        my left ear, even when I walk in here, is still ring.

      9             Q.   Okay.  So as you've been here today during the

     10        deposition, you've had a ringing in one of -- sensation

     11        in one of your ears?

     12             A.   Yeah.

     13             Q.   Okay.  When did you begin having a ringing

     14        sensation in at least one of your ears?

     15             A.   Maybe around 2017.

     16             Q.   Did it just come on gradually, or was there an

     17        event that caused you to notice its onset?

     18             A.   I do not know.  I didn't pay much attention,

     19        but there's one day I hear things.  I think some radio

     20        or something, but later I realize my ear rings.

     21             Q.   When you have an ear ring sensation, do you

     22        have other symptoms that cause it to happen, for

     23        instance, neck pain, things to that effect?

     24             A.   No.

     25             Q.   Okay.  Is there some sort of stimulus for you


                                                                     47


      1        having ear pain?

      2             A.   No.

      3             Q.   In other words, it comes on sporadically.

      4        There's not something that you notice as far as light,

      5        sound, anything to that effect?

      6             A.   Correct.

      7             Q.   Okay.  Have you received any medical treatment

      8        besides what we see in this chart note for the ear

      9        rings?

     10             A.   No medical at all.  Chart, I don't think chart

     11        has medicine she treat my ear ring because I do not

     12        remember doctor gave me any medication.

     13             Q.   Okay.  Turning back to Exhibit 3 in front of

     14        you, and this paragraph under ear issues, it also says

     15        left chest pain which started two to three years ago.

     16        Seen at the emergency department.  Do you recall having

     17        left chest pain episode?

     18             A.   Yes, I do recall.

     19             Q.   Okay.  And was that brought about by an event,

     20        or was it brought on sporadically?

     21             A.   There was no event.

     22             Q.   Okay.  How would you describe the chest pain

     23        you experienced two to three years before this 2019

     24        appointment?

     25             A.   Wait a minute.  I need to figure out this


                                                                     48


      1        chest pain and sending me to emergency room.  Is that

      2        correct?  Which year sending me to emergency room?

      3             Q.   So I'm referring to the very last paragraph on

      4        page 1 of Exhibit 3 in front of you, and it's --

      5                  MR. PURCELL:  I think that's the wrong

      6        exhibit.  I think it's this one here.

      7                  THE DEPONENT:  This one?

      8                  MR. PURCELL:  Yep.  I'm sorry.  I can't see.

      9                  THE DEPONENT:  Where it is, please.

     10        BY MR. MAACK:

     11             Q.   In this bottom part right there on page 1 of

     12        Exhibit 3.

     13             A.   Left chest two to three years ago when working

     14        seeing stress test was okay.  Which year this -- '19 --

     15        '19 -- '19 -- '18, so that would be 2017.

     16                  This recording is not accurate, two to three

     17        years ago.  It would be earlier than that.  But I don't

     18        remember which year, but I was still in GE.  This record

     19        should be -- wow.  Let me think about it.  It's much,

     20        much earlier.

     21                  I was sending -- because I can remember

     22        this -- I was sending to emergency room when I was the

     23        OHSU.  My doctor is OHSU.  That's 20 -- before 2016, two

     24        to three years too short, three year -- three years

     25        more.


                                                                     49


      1                  And so I had my doctor at OHSU was there for

      2        many years who I left there about 2016, and that's only

      3        another doctor.  So it has to be pushed forward two to

      4        three years before my last doctor who is Nancy Zink.  My

      5        longtime doctor was Fagnan, Lyle Fagnan.

      6                  This emergency room thing happened under

      7        Dr. Lyle Fagnan.  So that's much, much earlier.  This is

      8        not two to three years.

      9             Q.   Okay.

     10             A.   So it's many years.  But you can -- I cannot

     11        go through my chart over at OHSU anymore, but this --

     12             Q.   I guess the simple question is:  Do you

     13        remember which emergency room it was?

     14             A.   Yes, that's in Providence.

     15                  MR. GREGG:  Barnes?

     16                  THE DEPONENT:  St. Vincent XX is Barnes Road.

     17        BY MR. MAACK:

     18             Q.   Okay.  And do you remember having a stress

     19        test for your heart or for your chest?

     20             A.   Pardon me?

     21             Q.   Do you remember having a stress test?

     22             A.   Yes, I do.  Very clear.  Life event.  My

     23        goodness.  And, also, I want to mention after stress

     24        test, the tester told me you are the best.

     25             Q.   Okay.  So speaking towards your prior medical


                                                                     50


      1        history, we've talked about the kidney cancer and your

      2        recovery, the pain in your knees, your upper back pain.

      3        You also mentioned lower back pain.

      4                  Are there any other medical conditions that

      5        you experienced prior to the accident that are either

      6        not existent now or unrelated?

      7             A.   I said finger.

      8             Q.   Okay.

      9             A.   The finger joint.  That's also after the

     10        surgery.  I told my family doctor check everything out.

     11             Q.   Okay.

     12             A.   But I won't say -- those not related to the

     13        accident.  I didn't say they are.  I never claimed them.

     14             Q.   You never claimed them?

     15             A.   It's -- it's before, no, I never claim this

     16        was medical in the accident, my finger hurt.

     17             Q.   And then what you're talking about is just

     18        related to your finger; is that clear, or maybe I'm

     19        unclear about that actually.

     20             A.   Knee, knee pain.  I didn't claim knee pain.  I

     21        didn't claim my upper back pain.

     22             Q.   Uh-huh.

     23             A.   I claimed my lower back pain because my low

     24        back pain, it sometimes happen.  This chronic is all

     25        kind of pain, but after the accident, it's acute pain.


                                                                     51


      1             Q.   Okay.  So what you're saying is before the

      2        accident, your lower back pain was dull.  After the

      3        accident, it was acute; is that correct?

      4             A.   Acute for few weeks.

      5             Q.   For a few weeks?

      6             A.   Yeah.  And I did home therapy.  I fix it.

      7             Q.   Okay.

      8             A.   Doctor did check it, yeah.  I mean, my low

      9        back pain's not always there.  It's not pain now.

     10             Q.   It's my understanding that as a result of this

     11        accident, you're claiming that you suffered a

     12        concussion; is that correct?

     13             A.   Yes, I suffered a concussion, yes.

     14             Q.   And I just want to be totally clear, before

     15        this accident, had you ever been evaluated at any point

     16        for a cognitive condition?

     17             A.   Before the concussion, I did not evaluate the

     18        cognition.

     19             Q.   Okay.  Did you --

     20             A.   As I remember, I didn't.

     21             Q.   You remember --

     22             A.   As I remember, I did not have cognition

     23        evaluation before the concussion.

     24             Q.   Okay.  Did you ever undergo behavioral health

     25        treatment before the accident?


                                                                     52


      1             A.   No.

      2             Q.   Did you ever undergo any sort of mental health

      3        treatment before the accident?

      4             A.   No.

      5             Q.   And that includes seeing a therapist?

      6             A.   That is correct.

      7             Q.   Okay.  Besides the record we looked at in

      8        Exhibit 2 relating to your upper back and knee pain, had

      9        you ever seen a physical therapist before the accident?

     10             A.   For knee pain?

     11             Q.   For any reason.

     12             A.   Yeah, if before, that's many, many, many

     13        years.  I cannot recall I did.

     14             Q.   Okay.  So if I understand your response

     15        correct, you can't recall one way or the other if you

     16        did; is that --

     17             A.   No, I cannot recall if I see the therapist for

     18        the knee pain or for the back pain.

     19             Q.   Okay.

     20             A.   I'm sorry.  One moment.  Back pain -- no.

     21        After back pain, I see the therapist in China because,

     22        you know, it's accurate this happened in age 20.  So I

     23        see the doctors there for treatment.

     24             Q.   Okay.  No other doctors here though; is that

     25        correct?


                                                                     53


      1             A.   Of course every time you do the wellness check

      2        or, you know, you see doctor or you have a new doctor,

      3        everything is brought up.  Probably I do not complain my

      4        finger.  It was minor.  But I will tell them, I have

      5        back pain.  I have my knee pain.  But they will record

      6        it.

      7             Q.   Okay.

      8             A.   But they really do not take care of it.  Take

      9        notes.

     10             Q.   Gotcha.  Besides the kidney mass removal, had

     11        you ever had a surgery?

     12             A.   No.

     13             Q.   Had you ever broken a bone?

     14             A.   No.

     15             Q.   Have you been involved in any other motor

     16        vehicle accidents?

     17             A.   About maybe ten years ago I had a minor one at

     18        the traffic light.  I hit a car in front of me, a very

     19        minor touch of the bumper, and no -- no injuries.

     20        That's it.

     21             Q.   Okay.

     22             A.   I don't remember exact time.

     23             Q.   Have you ever seen a chiropractor before?

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   When was the last time you saw a chiropractor?


                                                                     54


      1             A.   Between the kidney surgery and the accident.

      2        Same time as the November, that kind of period, for

      3        2019, right?

      4             Q.   Do you recall the name of the chiropractor's

      5        office?

      6             A.   No.

      7             Q.   What state was that chiropractor in?

      8             A.   What date?

      9             Q.   State.

     10             A.   Oh, in Oregon, actually in Portland.

     11             Q.   What part of Portland?

     12             A.   Middleton.

     13             Q.   How many times did you see that chiropractor?

     14             A.   Two or three times.

     15             Q.   Are you able to look through your records and

     16        provide the name of that chiropractor?

     17             A.   I cannot recall.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Do you have any information at home

     19        which may refresh your memory as to the name of that

     20        chiropractor?

     21             A.   Pardon me?

     22             Q.   Do you have any information like a record or

     23        bill at home that you could use to refresh your memory

     24        as to the name of that chiropractor?

     25             A.   Not on top of my head.


                                                                     55


      1             Q.   Did you bill through insurance for that

      2        chiropractor?

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   Okay.  So would you be able to contact your

      5        insurance company and obtain the name of that

      6        chiropractor through insurance?

      7             A.   Okay.

      8             Q.   Okay.  If you could do that, that would be

      9        much appreciated.  Okay.  And within that same light, we

     10        know that you treated with Providence between your

     11        kidney surgery and the accident, and then you mentioned

     12        this chiropractor.

     13             A.   Excuse me.  Please speak a little bit slowly.

     14             Q.   Okay.  I'm sorry.

     15             A.   My brain is slow now.

     16             Q.   I know.  So between the date you had kidney

     17        surgery and the date of the accident, you can agree that

     18        you treated with Providence, and then you also saw this

     19        chiropractor, correct?

     20             A.   Yes.

     21             Q.   Okay.  Based on our conversation that we've

     22        just had, do you recall any other medical providers that

     23        you may not have recalled before but now you recall that

     24        you treated with during that time period?

     25             A.   Finger.  So my -- my family doctor, Katy, gave


                                                                     56


      1        me referral to the chiropractor and to the finger

      2        specialist.

      3             Q.   Okay.  I am planning to move on to talk about

      4        the car accident itself.  Is now a good time for another

      5        break, or do you want to keep going?  XX

      6                  MR. GREGG:  It's up to you.

      7                  THE DEPONENT:  Please speak slow so I can

      8        follow because of my brain already tired.

      9        BY MR. MAACK:

     10             Q.   Okay.

     11             A.   The accident still have that effect.  It's

     12        tire easily.

     13             Q.   I understand.  And I'll do my best.  I'm

     14        sorry.

     15             A.   Thank you.  So when I need a break, I will say

     16        let's have a few minutes break.

     12             A.   Yes.

     15             A.   Yes.

     16             Q.   Okay.  Where were you coming from that day?

     17             A.   That day, we were driving from Sandy Swimming

     19             Q.   Were you -- what were you doing before the

     20        accident happened?  What activities were you doing?

     21             A.   You mean when we are inside the vehicle or

     22        before that?

     23             Q.   Before that.  That's a good question.

                                                                     58

      6                  THE DEPONENT:  Not far from here.

      7        BY MR. MAACK:

      8             Q.   Do you recall how much time passed while you

      9        were at the swimming hole?

     10             A.   I -- I cannot remember exactly.  I can

     11        estimate.  We usually go there in the early afternoon

     12        and swim there.  And we left about 5:30.  No, not left

     13        before -- about -- yeah, after 5:00.

     14             Q.   Okay.  Did you travel from your home in

     15        Beaverton to the swimming hole?

     16             A.   Yes.

     17             Q.   And you arrived at the swimming hole early

     18        afternoon?

     19             A.   Yes.

     20             Q.   And then you left the swimming hole at 5:30

     21        p.m.?

     22             A.   After 5:00, yeah.

     23             Q.   After 5:00, okay.  And your destination was

     24        Fallen Leaf Park; is that right?

     25             A.   Lake.


                                                                     59


      1             Q.   Fallen Lake Park?

      2             A.   No, because I know it's Fallen Leaf Park.

      3             Q.   Leaf.  Okay.

      4             A.   No, I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  Fallen Leaf Lake.

      5                  MR. GREGG:  It's Falling Leaf.

      6                  THE DEPONENT:  Falling Leaf Lake.

      7        BY MR. MAACK:

      8             Q.   Falling Leaf.  Okay.  What were you planning

      9        to do at Falling Leaf Lake?

     10             A.   We are planning to find another good swimming

     11        spot.

     12             Q.   Had you been to Falling Leaf Lake before?

     13             A.   No.

     14             Q.   From the best of your memory, what time did

     15        the collision occur at?

     16             A.   It's around 5:30 because the police come here

     17        quite soon at 6:10 or 6:00 something.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Was it light or dark outside?

     19             A.   It's light.

     20             Q.   What was the weather like?

     21             A.   It's days like this.  It's a sunny day, yeah.

     22             Q.   Okay.  So in your own words, describe for me

     23        how the accident occurred.

     24             A.   I was driving toward the west from the Sandy

     25        Swimming Hole, and we are approaching the Fallen Leaf


                                                                     60


      1        Lake.  I know some car is behind me, but a few minutes

      2        ago, but when I'm making turn, you know, when I'm

      3        appropriating the Fallen Leaf Lake, I slow down like

      4        make the left and signal.

      5                  And I began to make the turn.  All of a

      6        sudden, a very strong hit from behind, boom, and I was

      7        confused.  My wife was confused.  We don't know what

      8        happened.  I thought I was driving into a ditch.

      9                  So my car stopped in the opposite lane.  I

     10        think for a moment.  I realized I must be hit by

     11        someone.  So I turn around.  I back my car back to the

     12        -- my direction on the roadside.

     13                  And the vehicle hit me actually was in front

     14        of me.  I don't know how he got there, but after he hit

     15        me, he is in front of me.  So I park behind there.

     16                  So a police car that happened to be after us,

     17        so he stopped.  He called others police come here to

     18        handle it.  Yeah, that's about it.  It's the version I

     19        had, boom, and my head is hurt.

     20             Q.   Okay.  Going back to the movement of your

     21        vehicle, when the impact happened, was your vehicle in

     22        motion, or was it stopped?

     23             A.   It's in motion.

     24             Q.   Did you see the other vehicle before the

     25        impact happened?


                                                                     61


      1             A.   What do you mean see other vehicle?

      2             Q.   Were you able to observe the other vehicle in

      3        one of your rear view mirrors, side mirrors, before the

      4        impact happened?

      5             A.   Not right before the impact, which means that

      6        being hit, that moment, I was looking left side of the

      7        park, you know, the direction I was going.

      8             Q.   Uh-huh.  So just maybe I didn't understand

      9        your answer clearly.  I just want to know whether you

     10        saw the vehicle coming upon you or if it was a total

     11        surprise that the impact was going to happen?

     12             A.   It's total surprise.

     13             Q.   Okay.  And how fast were you moving when the

     14        impact happened?

     15             A.   Wouldn't I say it's very slow, but I cannot

     16        estimate how fast.  That's why, because I'm making left

     17        turn, when he hit me, already stopped on the opposite

     18        lane.  I stopped there.

     19             Q.   Do you know the speed of the other vehicle?

     20             A.   No idea.

     21             Q.   Okay.  How much of your vehicle was in the

     22        opposing lane when the impact happened?

     23             A.   Most of it.

     24             Q.   Okay.  And the vehicle you're driving is a

     25        truck, correct?


                                                                     62


      1             A.   Pickup.

      2             Q.   Okay.  So was the full cab in the opposing

      3        lane when the impact happened?

      4             A.   I cannot remember exactly.  After hit, you

      5        know, it's a shock.  I didn't know what to do.  I didn't

      6        get out of the vehicle.  I just back it up, but I know

      7        I'm in the opposite lane.  It's how -- where is the

      8        position of your rear and in the -- across the center

      9        line or not, I'm not sure.

     10             Q.   Okay.  You testified that there was an impact

     11        to your head from the collision; is that right?

     12             A.   Correct.

     13             Q.   Okay.  Where did your head hit in the interior

     14        of your vehicle?

     15             A.   On the left side of my head, behind.

     16             Q.   Okay.  So the left side of your head hit the

     17        interior of your vehicle?

     18             A.   Should headrest.

     19             Q.   What direction were you facing when the impact

     20        happened?

     21             A.   I would say, of course, I looking at the

     22        direction I'm driving.  Since it hurt, my left side, it

     23        should be a little bit left --

     24             Q.   Okay.

     25             A.   -- making left turn.


                                                                     63


      1             Q.   Could you describe the headrest for me in the

      2        vehicle.

      3             A.   It's just headrest on the --

      4             Q.   Okay.  The reason I ask, in your medical

      5        records it says you hit a metal portion of the headrest.

      6        Do you recall reading that?

      7             A.   I read that.

      8             Q.   Okay.  So what I'm trying to understand is

      9        when the left side of your head hit the headrest, what

     10        was the metal portion you referred to in your medical

     11        records?

     12             A.   First of all, there is no metal inside my car,

     13        vehicle.  So the -- the headrest hit my head.  I don't

     14        know how that was recorded as the metal.  Maybe I

     15        mention the metal.  I'm not sure, but I understand when

     16        I see the XX I know the headrest, the inside, is metal.

     17             Q.   The inside of the headrest is metal, correct?

     18        Is that what you're saying?

     19             A.   Yeah.

     20             Q.   Okay.  And you're talking about the two prongs

     21        that connect to the seat?

     22             A.   Yeah.

     23             Q.   Okay.  And just so I understand your

     24        response -- maybe I don't understand your response.  Are

     25        you saying -- are you saying that you hit -- you did not


                                                                     64


      1        hit a metal portion of the headrest when the impact

      2        happened, or you did hit a metal portion of the

      3        headrest?

      4             A.   No, I just had hit by the headrest.

      5             Q.   Okay.

      6             A.   I didn't hit on any metal.

      7             Q.   Okay.  So it would've been the cloth portion

      8        supported by the foam, kind of your --

      9             A.   Pardon?

     10             Q.   -- standard headrest, correct?

     11             A.   Pardon me again?

     12             Q.   I'm sorry.  It would have been the -- the

     13        cloth with the foam covering that you would have hit

     14        with your head not --

     15             A.   Yeah.

     16             Q.   That's correct?

     17             A.   Yeah.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Thank you.  I know that was confusing.

     19        I just wanted to clarify that.

     20                  Did you speak with the other driver after the

     21        impact happened?

     22             A.   He talked to me only a few word.

     23             Q.   What did he say to you?

     24             A.   "Are you okay?"

     25             Q.   And how did you respond?


                                                                     65


      1             A.   As I remember, I either said:  Oh, a headache,

      2        or I didn't say anything.

      3             Q.   You don't know how you responded?

      4             A.   I just do not remember exactly, but she -- she

      5        didn't ask how are you or how do you feel or something.

      6        Did ask me.  I just said -- maybe I didn't say anything

      7        when I touch my head or I said:  Oh, I'm headache.

      8             Q.   Okay.

      9             A.   You know, after shock, I was really kind of --

     10             Q.   Were you able to exit your vehicle after the

     11        accident happened?

     12             A.   Yes, I do.

     13             Q.   Okay.  What did you do when you exited your

     14        vehicle?

     15             A.   I talked to the police behind us.  He was

     16        follow us.  He got out of his police car and talked to

     17        him.

      1                  MR. MAACK:  Mark this as Exhibit 4.

      2                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 4 was marked for

      3        identification.)

      4        BY MR. MAACK:

      5             Q.   And I'm showing you Exhibit 4.  Do you

      6        recognize the vehicle depicted in Exhibit 4?

      7             A.   Yes.

      8             Q.   Okay.  Are you able to explain where the

      9        damage to your vehicle was on Exhibit 4?  Does that

     10        accurately depict it?

     11             A.   It is.

     12             Q.   Okay.  And just so I'm clear, was this the

     13        vehicle you were driving on the date of the accident?

     14             A.   Yes.

     15             Q.   Okay.  Where on Exhibit 4 does it show damage

     16        from the motor vehicle collision?

     17             A.   How I can describe it, point to the picture.

     18        I mean, on the bumper, on the left side but not the

     19        total left.  It's one feet left of the license plate.  I

     20        -- looks like on the right side one feet from the

     21        license plate has some damage, also.

     22             Q.   Mr. Li, maybe an easier way to do this would

     23        be if you were able to circle it using a pen on Exhibit

     24        4.

     25             A.   Here is something else.  XX this nice book.

      1             Q.   And maybe we can trade that exhibit with the

      2        court reporter with your markings on it and --  and

      3        let's --

      4             A.   Is that okay?  It's clear.  This pen does not

      5        work very well.

      6                  THE REPORTER:  I can grab a highlighter in

      7        here.

      8                  THE DEPONENT:  A pencil does work.

      9                  MR. MAACK:  Are you going to be able to see

     10        that in the scanner, the exhibit?

     11                  THE DEPONENT:  XX.

     12                  THE REPORTER:  Yeah, I have a highlighter that

     13        I can -- we can circle this.

     14                  MR. MAACK:  Okay.  That will be better.

     15                  MR. GREGG:  She's going to get a highlighter.

     16                  MR. MAACK:  Let's do it on this one.

     17                  THE REPORTER:  I'll have you just re-circle

     18        this.

     19                  MR. GREGG:  Yeah, okay.

     20                  MR. MAACK:  Let's use this one.

     21        BY MR. MAACK:

     22             Q.   Do you see any other areas of your vehicle

     23        that were damaged that aren't depicted on Exhibit 4?  In

     24        other words, were there -- was there damage to the sides

     25        of the vehicle, the front, or is all the damage visible


                                                                     69


      1        on the exhibit that you're looking at right now?

      2             A.   Well, I believe one light on the panel was out

      3        after accident.  The insurance didn't pay for it, and I

      4        didn't argue with them.  Let it go.

      5             Q.   Okay.  Has your vehicle been repaired?

      6             A.   No.

      7             Q.   Do you still have it?

      8             A.   Yes.

      9             Q.   Okay.  And is it in the same condition that it

     10        was on the date of the accident?

     12             Q.   Did you receive compensation for the repair

     13        work to your vehicle?

     14             A.   Yes.

     15             Q.   Okay.  Is there a reason that you didn't have

     16        the vehicle repaired?

     17             A.   I want do it myself, but I cannot do it now.

     18             Q.   Any other details of the accident that you

     19        want me to know?  And just I'm talking narrowly about

     20        when the accident happened, not after the accident.

     21             A.   Repeat, please?

     22             Q.   Sure.  I'm talking just about on the date of

     23        the accident when it occurred.  And I'm asking you if

     24        there were any other details about the accident that you

     25        want me to know from what you remember.


                                                                     70


      1             A.   I cannot recall anything.

      2             Q.   Okay.  When did you first decide to receive

      3        medical care related to injuries you're claiming from

      4        the accident?

      5             A.   I think the third day, November 3rd, I think,

      6        if I'm -- you know, that's in my medical record.

     10        medical care?

     12             Q.   Do you have -- did you have a history of

     13        having headaches before this accident happened?

     15             Q.   Did you have a history of having nausea before

     16        the accident happened?

     17             A.   No.

     18             Q.   Okay.  And so when you saw a doctor on the

     19        3rd, was it mainly to address head-related issues?

     20             A.   Address the concussion.  One thing only.

     21             Q.   Okay.  Were you experiencing any sort of pain

     22        or discomfort below the neck, so in your back, knees,

     23        elbows, at that time?

     24             A.   My neck wasn't quite comfortable, but I do not

     25        remember complain to my neck.  At that time, I don't

      1        have the knee and the other issue mentioned in the

      2        doctor visit because I'm -- mainly, I'm worried about my

      4             Q.   Okay.

      5             A.   My head which means.

      6             Q.   And the doctor you saw, was that your primary

      7        care doctor on the 3rd of September 2020?

      8             A.   My prime -- my PCP is Katy.  She wasn't there

      9        that day.  I called the hospital, and the hospital gave

     10        substitute, which her partner Scott.  Scott is also FNP.

     16        BY MR. MAACK:

     17             Q.   Okay.  And it's my understanding from your

     18        medical records Scott referred you to Dr. Nelson for

     19        care; is that right?

     20             A.   No.

     21             Q.   Okay.  What happened next?

     22             A.   Scott give refer to physical therapist in the

     23        Orenco Sedation Clinic, which also belonged to the

     24        Providence, the whole group.  And I went there for

     25        physical therapy.  They're trying to fix my headache, my


                                                                     72


      1        dizziness.  Ask me.  I shake my head 95 times in

      2        minutes.  And after two weeks later, the symptom is not

      3        getting better.  It's getting worse.

      4                  So I worried.  I want to see my PCP.  So I

      5        called Katy, primary care provider, and that's 20

      6        something -- September 25th or 24th.  So she gave me

      7        referral to the Dr. Nelson.  Dr. Nelson is head doctor

      8        in the Providence Concussion Group.  From there,

      9        Dr. Nelson refer to other therapist.

     10             Q.   When you say your symptoms weren't getting

     11        better, they were getting worse --

     12             A.   Yeah.

     13             Q.   -- what do you mean by that?

     14             A.   Loss of sleep.  I couldn't sleep, more

     15        serious.  Headache, serious.  Nausea, serious.  Foggy.

     16             Q.   What do you mean by foggy?

     17             A.   I think they call it cloudy.  Brain not clear.

     18             Q.   Were you having any memory issues at that

     19        time?

     20             A.   That's only about two or three weeks after

     21        accident.  I haven't realized I had memory issue, but

     22        later, I found that my memory is dropping.  That's

     23        later.

     24             Q.   Is memory still an issue that you deal with

     25        today?


                                                                     73


      1             A.   Yes.

      2             Q.   Okay.  And is it long-term or short-term

      3        memory?

      4             A.   Short-term.

      5             Q.   Okay.  So on approximately September 25th, you

      6        saw Dr. Nelson.  And Dr. Nelson also referred you to

      7        occupational therapy and speech therapy; is that right?

      8             A.   Not quite right.  There's more.

      9             Q.   Okay.  What else happened?

     10             A.   Physical therapist, occupational therapist,

     11        and speech therapist.

     12             Q.   Okay.  You participated in those therapies at

     13        least initially until mid November of 2020; is that

     14        right?

     15             A.   Sorry.  My -- my brain is slow down now.  We

     16        are -- I had present accident in 2020.  November.  You

     17        are right.  Go into the November 2020.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Did your condition improve, stay the

     19        same, or get worse when you stopped treatment in

     20        November of 2020?

     21             A.   My concussion symptom is not straightforward,

     22        getting better or getting worse.  It fluctuate.  It's

     23        whenever you -- I did -- I overdo the -- overdid, the

     24        symptom got worse.  So 2020 November had one of the

     25        biggest setback in November about XX or something.  It's


                                                                     74


      1        terrible.  Is big setback.  The symptoms very severe.

      2                  For example, for the headache, I came back

      3        from the occupational therapist.  Because they're so

      4        demanding, you go to the occupational therapist, and you

      5        want to fill your forms, several pages, like little

      6        words, so many questions.  My brain cannot take that

      7        load.

      8                  Before we were walking into the clinic, I

      9        already fill the form about 20 some minutes.  So I would

     10        go there early, maybe 30 minutes, to fill out the form.

     11        I had the headache already kind of exploding, and

     12        actually those are noted by the therapist in my chart.

     13        And when I'm doing the therapist -- therapy, I always

     14        concentrate, push myself very hard.  I mean, that's like

     15        the occupational therapist -- no, not occupational --

     16        the speech therapist Beverly told me you are a doer.  I

     17        said do it.

     18                  So once so concentrated on my brain so much

     19        load, when I got home, went to relax, the symptom would

     20        come up.  When I go to the restroom, when I get up, my

     21        hand is kind of lower to my hip level.  And all of a

     22        sudden, my brains is like exploding.  I think the

     23        Dr. Nelson noted that in his chart later in the next

     24        year when I see -- see him again.  Like, the hundred

     25        needles throwing from inside my brains come shooting out


                                                                     75


      1        so I kind of crawl on to a couch.  I lay down.  And

      2        that's in November.

      3             Q.   Okay.  Is that -- so is -- that was what you

      4        were experiencing in November of --

      5             A.   2020.

      6             Q.   -- 2020?

      7             A.   Yeah.

      8             Q.   Okay.

      9             A.   And I --

     10             Q.   Hold on one second.  I have one more question

     11        to ask you --

     12             A.   Yeah.  Okay.

     13             Q.   -- just so I can get clarification.

     14                  MR. MAACK:  Can we mark this as Exhibit 6?

     15                  MR. GREGG:  I think it's 5.

     16                  MR. MAACK:  5.

     17                  THE REPORTER:  It's 5.

     18                  MR. MAACK:  5.

     19                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 5 was marked for

     20        identification.)

     21        BY MR. MAACK:

     22             Q.   If you could turn to page 2 and go -- of

     23        Exhibit 6 -- Exhibit 5 -- excuse me -- and then I'm

     24        going to refer you to the bottom of Exhibit 5 page 2

     25        where it says number of PT visits to date, visit


                                                                     76


      1        summary, concussion.

      2                  And do you see that portion where it says S

      3        feels much better, feels overall 80 percent better?

      4             A.   That's which day this visit?  Yeah, November

      5        11.  November 11.  Okay.  Yes, I read that.

      6             Q.   Okay.  So do you have any reason to dispute

      7        that on November 11th of 2020 you were feeling 80

      8        percent better, at least as this provider quantified?

      9             A.   Do I have anything to dispute it?

     10             Q.   Yeah.  Do you agree that that statement is

     11        accurate in Exhibit 5?

     12             A.   I agree that a description is accurate because

     13        if I said so, they note it here.  It should be true.  So

     14        for the dispute, as I said, the symptom come and it go

     15        depends the -- what I did.  So sometime that has

     16        setbacks.

     17                  I can check.  My setback is after this date or

     18        before this date.  So if after that date -- actually who

     19        is this person?  This is a therapist.

     20             Q.   Mr. Li, if you turn back to that same

     21        paragraph, you can see that it says that you did six

     22        hours of yard work with an hour-and-a-half break,

     23        correct?

     24             A.   If noted so I must told them there is no

     25        problem.


                                                                     77


      1             Q.   Okay.  So would you agree that there's at

      2        least one instance where you were able to do six hours

      3        of yard work with a one-and-a-half-hour break, correct?

      4             A.   Yes.  Correct.

      5             Q.   And then when you went to this appointment,

      6        you confirmed that you were 80 percent better at that

      7        time of the appointment?

      8             A.   Correct.

      9             Q.   Okay.

     10             A.   On the one-hour break is not seen I'm working

     11        six hour, had a one-hour break.  I think it's kind of --

     12        since I understand the concussion problem, I will work

     13        like 30 minutes, take a 15-minutes break, that kind of

     14        -- yeah.

     15             Q.   Okay.  And you reviewed your medical records.

     16        Would you agree that around this time period in November

     17        of 2020 you stopped with physical therapy, speech

     18        therapy, and occupational therapy at least temporarily?

     19             A.   Yes, I did stop it.

     20             Q.   Okay.

     21             A.   May I explain?

     22             Q.   Well, let me go to the next question.

     23             A.   Okay.

     24             Q.   After you stopped speech therapy, physical

     25        therapy, and occupational therapy, did you believe that


                                                                     78


      1        you had received any benefit from the therapies that you

      2        had been provided over that time period?

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   Okay.  Are you able to isolate one of the

      5        therapies that was more beneficial than the others?

      6             A.   2020, Beverly, occupation -- no, speech

      7        therapist.

      8             Q.   Okay.  Okay.  The next time you had medical

      9        treatment for your condition was in January of 2021; is

     10        that right?

     11             A.   Correct.

     12             Q.   Okay.  And during that appointment in January

     13        of 2021, you saw a doctor complaining of right facial

     14        numbness.  Do you recall that?

     15             A.   Yes.

     16             Q.   What symptoms -- well, describe the onset of

     17        the right facial numbness that you experienced at that

     18        time.

     19             A.   Oh, I was sit at dinner table.  All of a

     20        sudden, my right side of face and the -- my mouth and

     21        this numb.  I'm scared.  I call the doctor.

     22             Q.   Was that in January of 2021?

     23             A.   It's January 2021.

     24             Q.   Okay.  Are you relating that right facial

     25        numbness to this concussion from the car accident?


                                                                     79


      1             A.   I do not know.  That's subject to doctor.  And

      2        I do not know if he's covered by the auto insurance or

      3        not.

      4             Q.   Sure.  Okay.  February of 2021, you saw

      5        Dr. Nelson again.  Do you recall that?

      6             A.   Yes, I do.

      7             Q.   Okay.  And when you saw Dr. Nelson on February

      8        3rd of 2021, you told him that you were looking at

      9        screens, digital devices, for extended amounts of time;

     10        is that right?

     11             A.   Yes.

     12             Q.   Okay.

     13             A.   Yes.

     14             Q.   Why did you bring that up to Dr. Nelson in

     15        February of 2021?

     16             A.   Why I want to bring up?

     17             Q.   Yes.

     18             A.   Because that's the, you know, through the

     19        therapy, that's what you do each day is kind of have a

     20        diary.  You have tell them what you are doing.  You are

     21        reading too much.  You are hurting.  Remember, that's

     22        the year it got crazy reading.

     23             Q.   Were you maintaining a diary of your symptoms

     24        and conditions throughout this time period?

     25             A.   I do.  I do continue.


                                                                     80


      1             Q.   Okay.  And is that something that you did on

      2        your own, or was it something your attorney directed you

      3        to do?

      4             A.   I don't know attorney at that time.  You're

      5        saying in the area 2020, 2021, right, the journal of the

      6        PT treatment?

      7             Q.   What I'm trying to understand --

      8                  MR. MAACK:  And, Mr. Gregg, maybe you can tell

      9        me is whether that diary is subject to privilege or if

     10        it would be discoverable?

     11                  MR. GREGG:  I'm not sure that I was aware that

     12        you had a diary.

     13                  THE DEPONENT:  No, not diary.  No diary.  My

     14        understanding is the notes, the therapist, OT, PT,

     15        speech, they gave you.  You fill it.  Even you need to

     16        go back and like homework, and that kind of thing.  That

     17        knows that's called a diary.  I call it a diary.

     18                  MR. GREGG:  Clearly, he wasn't doing it at my

     19        direction.

     20                  MR. MAACK:  Okay.

     21                  MR. GREGG:  So if he was doing it to benefit

     22        his -- the diagnosis, that would apparently be

     23        discoverable, I would think.

     24                  MR. MAACK:  I would think so.

     25                  MR. GREGG:  Yeah.


                                                                     81


      1        BY MR. MAACK:

      2             Q.   Do you still have copies of the notes that you

      3        took and you relayed to your therapist?

      4             A.   Most are gone.

      5             Q.   Where did they go?

     11        run, did you have a headache, that kind of thing.  I

     12        did, but I don't know how much, how many, I can find

     13        them.  Probably none.

     14             Q.   Well, could you do a search at your home for

     15        those records?

     16             A.   Okay.  Okay.

     17             Q.   Okay.  Going back to the screen time, was your

     19        presidential election, politics, that effect?

     20             A.   Pretty much.

     21             Q.   Okay.  And from what I recall, that was

     22        ongoing before February of 2021.  In other words, had

     23        you been using a lot of screen since the date of the

     24        accident in September of 2020?

     25             A.   I cannot say that I used -- continually used

      1        the screen a lot daily, but, as I say, because do not

      2        use much screen is required.  So I use the screen

      3        sometimes.  I control my time, but I still use too much.

      4                  One reason also because physically I cannot

      5        move much because the concussion.  Okay.  So first we

      6        did, and I would say got mental health issues so I read

      7        and also the big election day, you know.

      8             Q.   And when we talk about screen usage, are we

     14             Q.   Are you able to provide your best estimate?

     15             A.   Three hours.

     16             Q.   And were you using the screen during the

     17        morning, midday, or evening?

     18             A.   Midday and evening.

     19             Q.   Would you use the screen while you were in

     20        bed?

     21             A.   Not much in bed.

     22             Q.   Okay.  What time would you stop using your

     23        screen?

     24             A.   Never stop using the screen, your cell phone.

     25             Q.   Well, you have to put it down at some point,


                                                                     83

      6             Q.   Were you still experiencing sleeplessness at

      7        that time?

      8             A.   At that time, yes.

      9             Q.   Do you still currently experience

     10        sleeplessness?

     11             A.   Much less in the past few month.  My sleep got

     12        much better.  I do have some sleepless night, but much

     13        less.

     14             Q.   Okay.  In February of 2021, how many hours of

     15        sleep were you --

     16             A.   Excuse me, can we have a --

     17                  MR. GREGG:  Do you need a break?

     18                  THE DEPONENT:  Yeah, I'm kind of tired.

     19        BY MR. MAACK:

     20             Q.   Are you able to answer the question first

     21        before we go to the break?

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   Do you want me to repeat it for you?

     24             A.   Yes, please.

     25             Q.   Okay.  In February of 2021, how many hours of


                                                                     84


      1        sleep per day were you getting?

      2             A.   I cannot remember that.  I do not record them.

      3                  MR. MAACK:  All right.  You want to take a

      4        break?

      5                  THE DEPONENT:  Yes, please.

      6                  MR. GREGG:  About ten minutes?

      7                  MR. MAACK:  Yeah.

      8                  THE REPORTER:  We're off the record at 4:19

      9        p.m.

     10                  (WHEREUPON, a recess was taken.)

     11                  THE REPORTER:  All right.  We're back on the

     12        record at 4:29 p.m.

     13        BY MR. MAACK:

     14             Q.   Mr. Li, when we went off the record, we were

     15        talking about some of the statements you made to

     16        Dr. Nelson on February 3rd, 2021.  Do you recall that?

     17             A.   I made some -- please, let's slow pace --

     18             Q.   Okay.

     19             A.   -- if you don't mind.  My brain's already

     20        fatigue.  I might feel a little bit of headache.

     21             Q.   Okay.  So I just want to make sure that we're

     22        at the same place chronologically.  When we went off the

     23        record, we were talking about your appointment with

     24        Dr. Nelson on February 3rd, 2021.  Do you remember that?

     25             A.   February 3rd, 2021, yes.


                                                                     85


      1             Q.   Okay.  And we were discussing screen time, et

      2        cetera?

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   Okay.  I want to pick up where we left off

      5        there.  Okay?  In February 3rd -- in February of 2021,

      6        had your symptoms related to the concussion gotten

      7        better, worse, or stayed the same?

      8             A.   I do not recall that.

      9             Q.   Okay.  Were you experiencing any new symptoms

     10        at that time?

     11             A.   No new symptoms.

     12             Q.   Do you recall that Dr. Nelson referred you

     13        back to physical therapy?

     14             A.   Yes.

     15             Q.   Okay.  And you went to physical therapy per

     16        the referral, correct?

     17             A.   Correct.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Based on the medical records I see, you

     19        went to one or two physical therapy appointments in

     20        February of 2021.  Do you recall that?

     21             A.   Let's clarify the question.  You said one day,

     22        no, you mean the Dr. Nelson referred me to the

     23        therapist, then I go, right?

     24             Q.   Correct.

     25             A.   Okay.  There's -- since the symptom is more


                                                                     86


      1        serious than before, Dr. Nelson referred more therapists

      2        and the doctor.

      3             Q.   Okay.

      4             A.   Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and

      5        the speech therapy were the same before in the 2020.

      6        Dr. Nelson referred again but added Dr. Stone for the

      7        neuro, if I remember correct.  I believe that's so.

      8                  What else?  Oh, yes.  One more.  Dr. Kim, the

      9        behavior, the psychologist because I got depressed for

     10        so long.  I didn't get XX awhile.

     11             Q.   Okay.  Do you recall how many times you went

     12        to physical therapy after Dr. Nelson referred you in

     13        February of 2021?

     14             A.   I don't recall.

     15             Q.   If I told you it was one or two times, would

     16        you disagree with that?

     17             A.   I would disagree.

     18             Q.   Okay.  You believe you went more than that?

     19             A.   Yes, one or two time, no, much more than that.

     20             Q.   Okay.

     21             A.   Oh to clear, so I'm clear, you are saying

     22        physical therapy only or the other therapist?  You were

     23        saying physical therapy is all, but some are other,

     24        occupational, speech.

     25             Q.   Uh-huh.


                                                                     87


      1             A.   Yeah, I make clear.

      2             Q.   Okay.  If we're talking about the group of

      3        occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech

      4        therapy, all together, do you believe you continued to

      5        go to appointments more than a few times in February of

      6        2021, or did you stop treatment?

      7             A.   2021, 2021, I did the whole year physical

      8        therapy.  It's a lot.

      9             Q.   Okay.

     10             A.   I do not remember how many.

     11             Q.   From -- so based on your recollection for

     12        physical therapy, you went for the entire year of 2021?

     13             A.   Again, clarify, it's not just physical

     14        therapy.  It's also occupational therapy and speech

     15        therapy and Dr. Kim and Dr. Stone.  2021, as I remember,

     16        I did the whole year.

     17             Q.   Okay.  Why did you stop the physical therapy?

     18             A.   When?

     19             Q.   In 2021.  Did you get better?  Did you get

     20        frustrated?

     21             A.   2021, the stop, it's getting better.

     22             Q.   Okay.

     23             A.   And it's -- it's actually no stop.  It to -- I

     24        think to December 2021, the treatment.

     25             Q.   And was that --


                                                                     88


      1             A.   Shouldn't stop.

      2             Q.   I'm sorry.  Was that therapy for symptoms

      3        related to your concussion or did it relate to other

      4        parts of your body?

      5             A.   Therapist about concussion only.

      6             Q.   Okay.

      7             A.   I said last -- last therapist is December,

      8        maybe November.  But, anyway, the whole year is almost

      9        to the last part of the year for the therapist.

     10             Q.   Okay.

     11             A.   Or for concussion.

     12             Q.   And from what you recall, you stopped because

     13        you got better in November or December of 2021?

     14             A.   There's no stop.  I mean, it's already in

     15        November, December.  You are questioning to see what did

     16        you stop in 2021.  In 2021, if you go to December, it's

     17        much -- not much to do, you know.  It's Thanksgiving,

     18        you know.  They -- the therapists need holiday, also.

     19             Q.   Okay.  And you said you got better.  What did

     20        you mean by saying you got better?

     21             A.   Concussion symptoms are less severe, less

     22        often, and I can walk more.  I can do more activities.

     23             Q.   In 2021, you also mentioned seeing Dr. Stone,

     24        the neuro-optometrist?

     25             A.   Yes, correct.


                                                                     89


      1             Q.   Okay.  And we talked a little bit before about

      2        your treatment with Dr. Stone.  Do you recall Dr. Stone

      3        giving you have a new prescription for glasses at that

      4        time?

      5             A.   Yes.

      6             Q.   Okay.  And those were the reading glasses that

      7        you had used before?

      8             A.   More than that.  The nearsight glasses, also.

      9             Q.   Nearsighted.  Okay.  Did the new glasses

     10        impact your symptoms in any way?  Did you feel like they

     11        helped your symptoms?

     12             A.   It helped a little bit, yeah.

     13             Q.   How did they help?

     14             A.   One thing, she gave me this -- not this one.

     15        What it called?  Change colors, got darker in the sun,

     16        so that I can -- for the -- my eye light sensitivity,

     17        that helps a lot.  Actually, she gave me a first

     18        prescription sunglasses.  I wear it about a month or so.

     19        And it's not strong enough.  So I go back.  I said you

     20        have a one XX.  Okay.  I have one XX so just change

     21        another one.  I feel better.

     22             Q.   Okay.

     23             A.   So it helps and also reading glasses has

     24        helped, too.  Less strain to my eye.

     25             Q.   Less strain to your eye, is that what you


                                                                     90


      1        said?

      2             A.   Yes.  I mean, the -- the glasses helps to

      3        reduce the eye strain when I look around.

      4             Q.   Did it also help reduce the eye strain when

      5        you'd look at screens?

      6             A.   Yes, a little bit.

      7             Q.   Okay.  Did you wear glasses when you'd look at

      8        screens?

      9             A.   Most of time.

     10             Q.   Okay.  And you -- is it your testimony that

     11        you noticed at least some difference when you got the

     12        new prescription glasses -- strike that.

     13                  Is it your testimony that your eye strain

     14        improved looking at screens once you got the new

     15        prescription glasses from Dr. Stone?

     16             A.   Yes.

     17             Q.   Okay.  From my review of your medical records,

     18        you did not have medical treatment from November 2021

     19        until July of 2022.  Do you recall that?

     20             A.   November 2021 to -- which month 2022?

     21             Q.   July.

     22             A.   Not quite right because you just mentioned

     23        2022.  In that 2022, you said I -- numbness I visited

     24        doctor, right?

     25             Q.   We discussed earlier that in January 2021 you


                                                                     91


      1        had the facial numbness.

      2             A.   Oh, 2021.  Okay.  I'm sorry.

      3             Q.   Yeah.

      4             A.   Okay.  After 2021, my -- the concussion

      5        symptom is lessened, and I feel better.  I did whole

      6        rest.  I'm kind of scared by the setback.  Before, I did

      7        lot less that winter, kind of couch potatoes.  In the --

      8        March, I feel and I thought or felt, I thought, that I'm

      9        okay now.  It's time to get on my feet.

     10                  I started increase walking distance, start

     11        jogging, increased jogging to a little bit low intensity

     12        HIIT, in high intensity interval training.  I tried

     13        several weeks and into April.  And the one day in April,

     14        probably mid-April, I did a two-mile smile run, which

     15        means when you run, you can talk to your partner easily,

     16        and, also, I did a few low intensity interval run like

     17        up to 60 there.  I still trying to recover.  Before

     18        that, I can do 100.  Now I do 60 percent of intensity

     19        run.

     20                  Then the next day, I just collapsed, just

     21        setback.  All the symptom come back when in the morning

     22        I wake up, I got headache, nausea, dizziness.  I would

     23        say all the symptoms just coming back to me.  I just

     24        laying in the bed and doing nothing for about a week.  I

     25        still not covered.  I -- I was so frustrated.  I mean,


                                                                     92


      1        it's -- it's one for my try to be healthy again.

      2        Occupational therapist Bethany told me, that's why I

      3        mentioned it.  She's one of the best.

      4                  She gave me this paper, draw square on the

      5        piece of paper.  You are in the middle.  You challenge

      6        the boundary, but never go outside for boundary or you

      7        little bit but do not go much.  If you go much, too much

      8        on the boundary, you got hurt.  You got setback.  Your

      9        symptom will come back.  That's what she told me.

     10        That's what exactly happened.  I did it too much, too

     11        quick.

     12             Q.   You were overdoing it at that time?

     13             A.   Over -- overdo -- definitely in April to May,

     14        okay.  Then I --

     15             Q.   Can I ask you one clarifying question?

     16             A.   Yes.

     17             Q.   When these symptoms manifested in April of

     18        2022 --

     19             A.   Manifested?

     20             Q.   Or when you started to feel the symptoms, the

     21        headaches, the nausea, the dizziness, was it while you

     22        were exercising or after you finished your exercise?

     23             A.   Not even after I finish exercise.  It's the

     24        next day.

     25             Q.   Okay.


                                                                     93


      1             A.   Continue?

      2             Q.   Continue in May of 2022.

      3             A.   Okay.  In May, so I just lay in bed.  I was so

      4        frustrated.  I know I go over the boundary.  I take rest

      5        so as to recover.  When it's recover, you can do

      6        exercises, challenge the boundary again, but after a

      7        month, I still not feel better.

      8                  So I began to worry.  Then I -- looking for

      9        help again in the concussion specialty group, which is

     10        Dr. Nelson.  So that's in July.  There's a reason come

     11        back because I was really worried.  I -- will I ever get

     12        better because after the April to May, the -- another

     13        try, I got hit back as terrible experience.  So, okay,

     14        but the Dr. Nelson left the hospital.  That's why I see

     15        the Dr. Hindagolla.

     16             Q.   Do you know how to spell that?

     17             A.   H-I-N -- maybe.  Okay -- D-O-L-O-G-A.  I'm

     18        sorry.  This may not be right.

     19             Q.   Okay.  I'm sorry.  I interrupted you.

     20             A.   That's okay.  I would say unfortunately she's

     21        -- she would be on labor.  So I only see her once.  So

     22        then I see Dr. Brown within those few month and the

     23        probably see another one.  I don't remember.

     24             Q.   That was my next question for you.  Dr. Brown

     25        is referenced in an August 17th, 2022 record.  Was he


                                                                     94


      1        with the concussion team at Providence, he or she?

      2             A.   Yes, she.  She is in the concussion team.

      3             Q.   Okay.  How many times did you see Dr. Brown?

      4             A.   I think once.  I do not remember exactly

      5        there.  I see Nelson three times and I see the Dr. Hin

      6        -- Hin and the once and then I see -- I'm sorry -- my

      7        brain's slow now -- Dr. Brown.  I do not remember if I

      8        see another doctor or just Dr. Brown once or didn't see

      9        any more or maybe the Dr. Brown is the last doctor that

     10        I've seen.

     11             Q.   Okay.  It's my understanding that when you

     12        returned to treatment in July of 2022 you returned to

     13        physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech

     14        therapy for --

     15             A.   And neuro eye, Dr. Stone.

     16             Q.   Okay.  And you concluded all of those

     17        therapies in August -- at the end of August 2022; is

     18        that right?

     19             A.   Yes.

     20             Q.   Okay.

     21             A.   Didn't conclude.  I did see physical therapist

     22        probably until October 2022.

     23             Q.   That therapist was with Providence, as well?

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   Do you remember what clinic?


                                                                     95


      1             A.   I know the clinic, but I cannot remember the

      2        name, but if you let me use my cell phone, I can find

      3        out.

      4             Q.   Maybe we can look after your deposition and

      5        clarify.

      6             A.   Yeah.

      7             Q.   What I'm kind of getting at or wondering is

      8        what additional treatment, if any, you've had for

      9        concussion symptoms since the end of August 2022 to

     10        present day?

     11             A.   Basically, I understand, but please repeat

     12        again.

     13             Q.   Sure.

     14             A.   Make sure I understand.

     15             Q.   Okay.  From the end of August of 2022 to

     16        today's date, what additional medical care have you had

     17        related to your concussion symptoms?

     18             A.   So stop that physical therapist in 2022

     19        October, August to October sometime, and that's that.

     20        That's it.  I didn't seek any more treatment.

     21             Q.   Is there a reason why not?

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   Could you tell me the reason.

     24             A.   It's -- how to explain it.  I was in peak

     25        major form for 20 some years.  That's my first career.


                                                                     96


      1        For the therapist, especially the physical therapist, I

      2        understand quite a bit.  So if they assign me something,

      3        I can do it by myself.  I can be do it -- can do it

      4        effectively.  And that's physical therapist.

      5                  Part of the reason I quit this physical

      6        therapist is I do not believe his treatment is giving me

      7        the need, my goal.  That's not meet my need, meet my

      8        need, which means conditioning, recover, quick.  He gave

      9        me exercises.  I said I can -- some on the table just

     10        like this.  I'm sorry.  I stand here.  Have to jump up

     11        and kind of land on the desk.

     12                  And he said I want to keep you in that

     13        ability.  He gave me -- assigned me some exercises

     14        increasing my muscle.  That's very good, very, I mean,

     15        particularly to this, it's very good.  He's a very good

     16        therapist.

     17                  But to my concussion problem, that's not the

     18        main problem.  Main problem is my conditioning.  If I do

     19        too much, back to zero.  Who was the best PT?  Before

     20        him, AB.  AB gave me conditioning treatment, however, I

     21        saw AB two or three times, and he was on vacation.

     22                  So the OT, occupational therapist, they call

     23        me to -- he said -- she said you need physical therapist

     24        now.  So I didn't have a wait for AB, the PT, come back.

     25        Though I like her.  Bad thing is later, in October --


                                                                     97


      1             Q.   I'm sorry.  Could you clarify which year of

      2        October.

      3             A.   2022.

      4             Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

      5             A.   She took note that I didn't go back this

      6        therapy.  The patient quit.  It's not I quit.  I go to

      7        another therapist after she left maybe in July or

      8        August.  She went on vacation.  And I keep on the

      9        physical therapy until October.

     10                  Okay.  Back to your question is why I quit.

     11        For the -- I have so many reasons.  For the occupational

     12        therapy -- no, I'm sorry, again, the speech therapy is

     13        cognition related issue.  They give you test, see how

     14        your cognition is.  Beside that, just a bit the

     15        principle, short square, like Beverly said.  You are in

     16        the boundary.  You do not go back.  So I was seeing for

     17        in 2020 because the COVID and in 2020, end of the 2020,

     18        I started the therapy.

     19                  I did do one or two virtual visit.  It's --

     20        no, that's not right.  You cannot do physical therapy

     21        through the phone or video.  So I -- that's one reason I

     22        stopped at 2020.

     23                  And so in 2022 I see the -- I was referred to

     24        her again.  The same thing, she said, okay, you -- the

     25        squares.  Okay.  I said you have your notes here.  The


                                                                     98


      1        square, and I will go out of the boundary.  So in my

      2        opinion, you see them a few times.  You know the basics.

      3        That's it.  I do not want to go there each time they

      4        pass you again.  How can you read fast?  Can you read it

      5        backward?  And I know -- I know this sort of thing can

      6        help you.  But the most important thing is do not go out

      7        of the boundary.  That's most important thing.  That's

      8        what I was trying to do.

      9                  And also the behavior therapy, Dr. Kim, and

     10        she told me the mind for me you leave your moments.  You

     11        do not think about it further.  She's great help.  Make

     12        me feel much better.  I was so depressed.  After talking

     13        to her, I feel much better.  But, again, I saw her

     14        probably three times, which mean you -- no, you read

     15        that book.  You should do it.  Then you do not see her

     16        again.

     17             Q.   Okay.  How are you managing your symptoms at

     18        home without medical care since October of 2022?

     19             A.   Basically you follow the therapist guidelines.

     20        First and the most important thing, don't do too much.

     21        That's what my symptom got reduced.  My -- the frequency

     22        of the setback is much less.  Some of them got, yeah,

     23        but the explain that I cannot recover soon, you know.

     24        The condition is that three years you didn't move much.

     25        This is deconditioned.  It is the muscle, the soreness


                                                                     99


      1        and XX all.  You want to go back to the -- to do

      2        conditioning in the back to my condition before the

      3        accident.  That's need a lot of practice.  Now I'm, from

      4        bottom of my heart, feel sad.  I wonder if I'll ever be

      5        back to my condition before.

      6             Q.   So, Mr. Li, from your response, I understand

      7        you're not overdoing it; is that correct?

      8             A.   I'm trying to not overdoing it.  And the for

      9        the last few months --

     10             Q.   I'm trying to put this into a shorter

     11        response.  So you're not overdoing it.  Are there any

     12        other exercises or techniques that you use at home to

     13        manage your symptoms now?

     14             A.   Oh, practicing some of the balance things, you

     15        know, some therapist assigned before.

     16             Q.   Okay.  What symptoms do you still experience

     17        that you relate to this car accident?

     18             A.   Oh, my goodness, for example, today, I already

     19        got a headache because this is so intense and also I

     20        already work several day to prepare it and a lot to

     21        read.  And when you ask questions, a high pay attention,

     22        and all the headache.  And it seem like concussion

     23        syndrome is come back as a group.  What cost?  I

     24        suddenly feel -- my eye, the light sensitivity, it's

     25        come back.


                                                                    100


      1             Q.   When is the last time you experienced light

      2        sensitivity?

      3             A.   There is no last time because it's better,

      4        better, better.  At the beginning, I was remove all the

      5        light inside the bathroom.  I put a small one.  And then

      6        I may have to turn off the light inside room.  I turn on

      7        the light outside, and I walk into the room.

      8             Q.   Okay.

      9             A.   But then it's get better, better, better.  You

     10        have sunglasses.  Go out.  It's okay.  So gradually,

     11        gradually, it's much less, much less.  You know, it's

     12        winter.  I feel better.  But, you know, the summer, I --

     13             Q.   Okay.

     14             A.   Yeah, but, it's also now, it's in the mornings

     15        okay, but suddenly, I feel this week I went out, and

     16        it's so bright.  So I grab another one.

     17             Q.   So and I'm just trying to understand your

     18        current condition.  I know it's been a long day.

     19             A.   Yeah.

     20             Q.   So we have headaches.  You're saying that

     21        right now you experience light sensitivity.  Are there

     22        any other symptoms that you experience now or within

     23        this general time frame that you attribute to the

     24        accident?

     25             A.   Yes.  I already feel my stomach a little


                                                                    101


      1        upset.  This morning I have it, but later it is okay,

      2        but now okay I feel.  Also, you want my understanding is

      3        slowing down.  That's beginning, I can talk to you like

      4        this, but sit straight, and I didn't have to lean

      5        forward and put my right ear toward you which will help

      6        me to understanding better.  My brain -- my brain

      7        understand is slow.  Why if I seem foggy, I don't know

      8        how to describe it.  It just hurt.

      9             Q.   Are you telling me that you understand my

     10        speech better when you lean forward and listen --

     11             A.   Yes, and to put my left ear here the better

     12        put my hand on my ear.

     13             Q.   Okay.

     14             A.   That's kind of a stronger stimulation into my

     15        ear.  I can hear you better, and I understand better.

     16             Q.   Okay.  We've talked a lot about physical

     17        activities that you did before the accident and

     18        activities you can no longer do.

     19                  Could you try the best you can to tell me any

     20        other ways this accident has impacted you beyond the

     21        physical component of it?  Does that make sense?

     22             A.   I think so.  Beyond the physical, what else

     23        impact my life?

     24             Q.   Correct.  Yes.

     25             A.   Well, I like read.  I read a lot of books,


                                                                    102


      1        especially critical thinking, logic, and some other

      2        things.  However, since the accident, it's too hard.  At

      3        the beginning is I cannot read it and because it demands

      4        brain power.  So I cannot read those serious things

      5        which require the logical thinking.  But I can read

      6        fictions, biographies where you do not need much

      7        thought, relax and read.  That, I can read a couple

      8        hours.

      9             Q.   Okay.

     10             A.   And so that's -- oh, mentally.  I do not like

     11        to say that I'm depressed, but I think I'm a little low

     12        spirited so.  Also, I feel -- maybe back to the

     13        physically -- the bigger -- I don't know how to

     14        understand this.

     15                  The -- before the accident, you know, you feel

     16        the energy.  You have a bigger, oh, I want to do it,

     17        that kind of thing.  But I think two years after I --

     18        after the big setback in 2022, it's diminishing.  It's

     19        just no longer have the power, have the energy, have

     20        that strength.  And, also, if I do something, I have to

     21        be careful.  Don't hurt yourself.

     22             Q.   How do you occupy your time now?

     23             A.   Walk around, ride a bike, and do some DIY,

     24        yard work.  I bought a van that I want to do the RV, but

     25        this is -- this is happening.  I didn't do much.  It's a


                                                                    103


      1        lot work to do.  I haven't done much, but I'm trying.

      2             Q.   Have your relationship -- has your

      3        relationship with your wife been affected because of the

      4        injuries you're claiming?

      5             A.   No.

      6             Q.   Okay.

      7             A.   It has benefited the relationship with my wife

      8        because -- because the concussion?

      9             Q.   I just asked if it had been affected by it?

     10             A.   Yes, it is affected, of course.

     11             Q.   Okay.

     12             A.   The concussion affected me and my wife and the

     13        life together.

     14             Q.   Just because I have to understand your

     15        injuries and how it's affected you, could you explain to

     16        me, and I'll ask you to try to keep it as short as

     17        possible, just how your relationship with your wife or

     18        other family members has been affected due to your

     19        injuries?

     20             A.   Be affected.  First of all, I would say after

     21        the injury, my wife would drive a lot.  She has to go

     22        with me, go to the clinic sometimes.  Here at beginning

     23        goes a lot of times.  The physical therapy is like a

     24        full-time job.  At the time, I have five therapists or

     25        doctors, occupational, PT, speech, neuro, and


                                                                    104


      1        psychologist.  So it's occupies, you know, it's not

      2        normal life anymore.  This is full-time patient.  And,

      3        also, we usually go together hiking.  Like I said, in

      4        the COVID, year 2020, we cannot go hiking because hiking

      5        was prohibited at that time in the Portland.  So we go

      6        to park each day, and we jog or run.  We are practice so

      7        hard.

      8                  That's what I'm saying.  I have video I send

      9        to Mr. Gregg.  I don't know if you have it.  I jump the

     10        picnic table, eight of them in a row there.  We -- she

     11        run there.  She follow me because I was a PE teacher.

     12        She -- I would show her you how you do the strap, how do

     13        you do that, and then she would follow me.  We went

     14        together.

     15                  When I got injured, I pray that she is not go.

     16        She does not go anymore.  If she go, my active level is

     17        dropped considerably, you know.  I only can walk now and

     18        much shorter time.  I walk 20 minutes, 30 minutes.  Oh,

     19        let's go home.

     20                  But before that, I do two hours.  She do hour,

     21        and, you know, now it's affecting her lifestyle.  That's

     22        why I feel very sad I do not can XX.

     23             Q.   Do you have any plans for future medical care

     24        -- we can take a break.  I'm sorry.

     25             A.   That's okay.  Future medical care, right now,


                                                                    105


      1        I'm not sure.  Now I'm trying to manage itself based on

      2        my professional knowledge, which was a PE teacher over

      3        probably 20, 25 years, but I may go back to physical

      4        therapist, especially the AB.  What she told me is,

      5        okay, you called the speech therapist says draw a line

      6        and draw a square.  You do not go outside.  It's just

      7        the principle.  They didn't tell you how to do it.

      8                  And, as me, as a doer, and also my body's

      9        always late.  I think there is a special term.  I have

     10        late reaction to my fatigue.  I will not feel if I work

     11        hard today, I will not feel that.  And I can work

     12        tomorrow very strongly, but the third day or fourth day,

     13        I will feel real tired.  So drawing this square, by

     14        principle, it will help you a lot, but they didn't tell

     15        me how to do it.  But AB told me.

     16                  AB asked me to run on the treadmill and check

     17        my heart as to my symptom.  If you feel symptom, you say

     18        you feel nausea, it's rated 2 over 10.  If you feel 2

     19        point heart, you stop.  She watch my heart rate and know

     20        that heart rate is, I'd say, 117.  You got your nausea

     21        from two two four.  You start, you remember that heart

     22        rate.  You go practice.  Do not go over the 117.  So I

     23        followed that principle for quite a long time.  I run

     24        you on -- not running, actually walking, not running,

     25        maybe walk fast, 100 to 120, do not go over 120.


                                                                    106


      1                  But before the concussion, I would run the 100

      2        percent intensity HIIT.  This go to 160s.  So, anyway,

      3        if I feel I need the treatment, I will go back to AB for

      4        more guidance, but for now, from my knowledge from what

      5        she told me, I think I can handle it awhile.

      6             Q.   Okay.

      7             A.   Yeah, it's gradually I challenge that boundary

      8        120, 125.  You've got two weeks.  Don't do it too fast.

      9        Now it's tomorrow.  Now you can think hopefully I can.

     10                  MR. MAACK:  That's all I have.

     11                  MR. PURCELL:  I just have a few follow ups.

     12        You covered almost everything that I was going to cover.

     13        EXAMINATION

     14        BY MR. PURCELL:

     15             Q.   You mentioned earlier that you love to read

     16        books that require critical thinking.

     17             A.   Can you please slow down.

     18             Q.   Sure.  You said earlier that you enjoy reading

     19        books that require critical thinking and that you're

     20        still able to read fiction or biographies but not those

     21        more complex books.  What kind of books?

     22             A.   I cannot read the -- remember the book.  It's

     23        a textbook, but I remember I took three online classes

     24        of critical thinking.  The one class I liked the most, I

     25        cannot remember that.  This is quite a bit, you know,


                                                                    107


      1        before the injury, is a university in the United States,

      2        two guys.  It's very funny.  It's a very interesting

      3        class, and I got a lot.  I also watched the critical

      4        thinking by the Oxford University, a woman instructor.

      5        Frankly I do not -- not as good as the U.S. one.  So I

      6        just -- just give up.  Another one is a Chinese.  It's

      7        online classes.

      8             Q.   So are these -- is the topic itself critical

      9        thinking?

     10             A.   Yes, it's about critical thinking, what it is.

     11             Q.   Okay.  And these are classes that you were

     12        taking before the injury?

     13             A.   Yes, correct.

     14             Q.   And have you tried to do anything similar

     15        since your injury?

     16             A.   No.

     17             Q.   Okay.  I'm going to jump around a little since

     18        we're covering several bases here that my co-counsel's

     19        already asked you about.

     20                  The day of the accident, after the crash, what

     21        did you do?

     22             A.   Excuse me.  Slow -- slow down a little bit.

     23             Q.   Sure.  On the day of the accident, after the

     24        crash, what did you do then?

     25             A.   After the crash, the first police, she's not


                                                                    108


      1        handling the traffic.  She basically would -- she talked

      2        to me and explained what happened, and she called.

      3        Other two police come.

      4                  So I, of course, I talked to the police,

      5        investigate, et cetera.  And then also one of them,

      6        probably first police, asked me:  Do you want ambulance?

      7        I said:  I can sit and talk to you, which means, you,

      8        know, I'm still okay.  So I refused politely, and then I

      9        drove home.

     10             Q.   Okay.  You did not go to the park?

     11             A.   Oh, no.

     12             Q.   So after the accident, just to clarify, the

     13        police officer asked if you wanted an ambulance.  You

     14        politely declined.

     15             A.   Yeah.

     16             Q.   And then you drove home?

     17             A.   Yeah.

     18             Q.   Who drove?

     19             A.   I drove.

     20             Q.   You drove.  What did you do when you got home?

     21             A.   I do not remember.  Should be rest because,

     22        you know, after days went after a collision, I must have

     23        been take a rest.

     24             Q.   Okay.  What years were you a PE teacher?

     25             A.   1974.


                                                                    109


      1             Q.   Until when?

      2             A.   Until -- well, 1988, not to yet.  It's 1988 I

      3        came to the United States.  So I'm still in the PE for

      4        another couple of years.  So I was in XX then.

      5             Q.   So to clarify, you were working as a PE

      6        teacher in China from 1974 to 1988?

      7             A.   Yes.

      8             Q.   And then in America from 1988 until when?

      9             A.   1990.  It's not working.  It's exchange

     10        visitor.  I study here.

     11             Q.   Study here until 1990?

     12             A.   Yes.

     13             Q.   What did you do after 1990?  I understand you

     14        eventually got into software engineering, but that

     15        wasn't until 1997, right?

     16             A.   Yes.  Correct.  1990, I married with my wife,

     17        and I was here.  I do not -- I did not want to go back

     18        because, you know, the Tiananmen Square incident.  Even

     19        before that, I said:  If they shoot, I will not go back.

     20        So I stayed.

     21                  I got married 1990.  And that work here of

     22        some jobs, and also I take the community education

     23        classes and to prepare for my computer science study.

     24        And, finally, I got admitted, and I got my degree.

     25        That, I will tell you with that -- that's something


                                                                    110


      1        really deep into the history of China.  I don't know if

      2        I want to say that.

      3             Q.   Certainly.  And I'm not trying to probe into,

      4        you know, historical or -- historic or political issues

      5        here.

      6             A.   I mean, if you like to listen, I can talk to

      7        you for minutes or even hours, right?

      8             Q.   That's okay.  I'm just trying to figure out

      9        why you chose the career path that you did.

     10             A.   I want to.  Since you said why you change your

     11        career.  Okay.  When I in the fifth grade, cultural

     12        revolution started in 1966.  My father was son of a

     13        businessman before the communists seized China in 1949.

     14        My mother was daughter of landlord -- no, excuse me --

     15        warlord.  So they are treated by the communists,

     16        second-class citizen.  It's capitalist.

     17             Q.   Uh-huh.

     18             A.   So in the cultural revolution, my parents was

     19        quarantined by the workplace, the work.  I lost school.

     20        I have nowhere to go.  So when I was graduated, it's not

     21        graduate, I lost school.  Then I, after elementary, go

     22        to middle school.  The school class is not normal.  And

     23        the -- my parents was quarantined at the time in there

     24        -- where they work.  They cannot come out to me, cannot

     25        help me.


                                                                    111


      1                  Then because my school year was over, you ask

      2        where do you want to go.  I like engineering.  And in

      3        the elementary school, I'm straight A student.  So I

      4        want to go to engineering school.  Then I feel the --

      5        tell the teacher what I want to do, but, actually, at

      6        that point political turmoil, there is no admit at the

      7        engineering school open.  I mean, they are not take

      8        student.  But who cares.  No one care.

      9                  I just waited and waited.  And then my advisor

     10        in China, this means this whole class is -- this teacher

     11        is responsible for the whole class.  He's really nice to

     12        me.  He told me there is a physical education.  You can

     13        go.  But I have no one I can talk to say is this my

     14        life.  I only 17, about 17.

     15                  So I just go and had an interview and a little

     16        better then.  It's not normal time.  It's just XX few

     17        things, and I was accepted.  And I go to that school.

     18        School is neither normal.  This is 1972.  I didn't like

     19        it, and I have nowhere to go.  I talk to my class lead

     20        classmate in the week.  We stayed.

     21                  So physical education wasn't my choice.  It's

     22        -- I was forced to there, into there, until 1970 even

     23        though I did -- I did do good, pretty good, for the --

     24        my study in that after graduation, the teacher keep me

     25        in the school to be a teacher.  I went teacher of the


                                                                    112


      1        school I attend, but I never like it.  So even go to

      2        '70s, I still try to change my career.  However, in

      3        China, it's different from this country.  You can't just

      4        quit job, find another one.  No, you quit a job, you

      5        have nothing.

      6             Q.   Understood.

      7             A.   That changed after -- after late '80.  So but

      8        I got a chance --

      9                  MR. GREGG:  We're really getting off the

     10        topic.

     11                  THE DEPONENT:  Oh, sorry.  Let me quick

     12        finish.  Okay.  Then I got a chance, thanks XX.  That

     13        time in 1988 I come to the United States.  So I very

     14        thankful for the American who gave me chance --

     15             Q.   Okay.

     16             A.   -- to change my major.  I know, I understand,

     17        but that's my personal experience.  It's very emotion

     18        for me.

     19                  MR. PURCELL:  You know what, I think that that

     20        is all I'm going to ask today.  Thank you, sir.

     21                  THE REPORTER:  Mr. Purcell, would you like to

     24                  THE REPORTER:  And then, Mr. Maack, would you

      2                  THE REPORTER:  And then, Mr. Gregg, would you
