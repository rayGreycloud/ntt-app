     14        JOHN BANNES, having been first duly affirmed to tell the

     16        EXAMINATION

     17        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     18             Q.   Mr. Bannes, can you please state your name for

     19        the court reporter?

     20             A.   My name is John Bannes, B-A-N-N-E-S.

     21             Q.   Okay.  And do you understand that you're under

     22        oath today so your testimony would have the same effect

     23        as being in court?

     24             A.   Yes, sir.

     25             Q.   So I'm going to ask you questions to which I


                                                                      5


      1        want based on your personal knowledge.  Don't guess or

      2        assume.  You know with that being said, if you answer

      3        the question, I'm going to assume you have knowledge,

      4        and you know how to answer it.

      5                  Is there any reason that you can think of

      6        today why you would not be able to testify?  Don't feel

      7        well.  Medications.  Anything like that?

      8             A.   Not at this time.

      9             Q.   Okay.  Have you ever testified in a deposition

     10        before?

     11             A.   Yes, sir.

     12             Q.   How many times?

     13             A.   At least once.

     14             Q.   At least once.  Okay.  And what was that

     15        involving?

     16             A.   The Tollway taking the property.

     17             Q.   Tollway --

     18             A.   Yes.

     19             Q.   -- taking a property?

     20             A.   Yeah.

     21             Q.   Was that your property --

     22             A.   For maintain --

     23             Q.   -- being taken?

     24             A.   Yes, they were taking my property.

     25             Q.   So that was the government taking it?


                                                                      6

      2             Q.   Okay.

      3             A.   Well, the government is not really -- Tollway

      4        is not really the government.

      5             Q.   Okay.

      6             A.   They're quasi.

      7             Q.   Okay.  Understood.  But you testified as a

      8        respondent in that case?

      9             A.   I don't know I was a respondent or --

     10             Q.   Okay.

     11             A.   -- because it was a matter of fighting over

     12        the issues of the value.

     13             Q.   Okay.  And how long ago was that?

     14             A.   When did they build 355 --

     15             Q.   Just --

     16             A.   -- from 55 south.

     17             Q.   Okay.  So --

     19             Q.   Okay.  So quite some time ago?

     20             A.   Yeah.

     21             Q.   Okay.  So that's the one deposition that you

     22        recall.  You're not sure if you've done any others?

     23             A.   No.

     24             Q.   Okay.  Have you ever been convicted of a

     25        crime --


                                                                      7


      1             A.   Oh, yes.  I was in an auto accident.

      2             Q.   An auto accident.  Okay.

      4             Q.   And you were the defendant or respondent in

      5        that case, or you were the plaintiff?

      6             A.   I was hit.  I was trying to collect damages so

      7        I guess I was the plaintiff.

      8             Q.   Okay.  Have you ever been convicted of a

                                                                      8


      1             Q.   Yes.  Well, let me -- I want to do a two-part

      2        there.  How many companies or properties have you owned

      3        personally in the last five years?

      4             A.   Three, I believe.

      5             Q.   Okay.  And are those all located in Illinois?

      6             A.   No.  One of them was in Michigan.

      7             Q.   Okay.  How many properties have you owned by

      8        and through your company JEBEX (sic) RE Limited?

      9             A.   JEXEB has only owned one property.

     10             Q.   Okay.

     11             A.   Ever.

     12             Q.   So you have three properties that you've

     13        purchased individually in the past five years?

     14             A.   I -- no.

     15                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  Misstates his

     16        testimony.  You asked him what he owned.

     17                  MR. KHWAJA:  Oh, I'm sorry.

     18        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     19             Q.   Okay.  You owned three properties.  And how

     20        did you acquire those three properties?

     21             A.   I don't still own all those properties.

     22             Q.   Okay.  But you did?

     23             A.   I did over five years I owned all those three

     24        properties.

     25             Q.   Okay.


                                                                      9


      1             A.   Yes.  Yes.

      2             Q.   And of those three properties, have all three

      3        been sold?

      4             A.   Two are sold.

      5             Q.   Okay.  And what was the manner of the

      6        transaction?  Did you set up an installment contract or

      7        anything similar where the client would pay you monthly

      8        mortgage payments?

      9             A.   No, they were conventional mortgages or

     10        convention payments.  Nah, I think the one was a

     11        complete cash purchase.

     12             Q.   But when you sold the properties I'm referring

     13        to.  Let's -- let's go through the three properties.

     14        The first one --

     15             A.   The current property I live in.  I have a

     16        conventional mortgage.

     17             Q.   Is that in Joliet?

     18             A.   Yes, sir.

     19             Q.   Okay.  So you have one property in Joliet.

     20        And what are the locations of other two?

     21             A.   One was in Michigan.  It was vacant land in

     22        Michigan.

     23             Q.   Uh-huh.

     24             A.   I owned it for 30 years.

     25             Q.   Okay.


                                                                     10


      1             A.   And in the last four or five, I sold it.

      2        Advertised it for sale.  Sold it.

      3             Q.   The last four to five, I thought you had three

      4        properties in the last --

      5             A.   Yeah, I owned it within the last five.

      6             Q.   Oh, in the last --

      7             A.   I sold it in the last five.

      8             Q.   Okay.  So where was the third property

      9        located?

     10             A.   The third property was the house I -- this

     11        house, I came from a rental.  The house before the

     12        rental would have been the Oswego house.  And I sold it

     13        to JEXEB.

     14             Q.   Okay.  So of the three properties we've

     15        discussed, you're actually counting the one you live in

     16        in Joliet?

     17             A.   Yes, sir.

     18             Q.   The one in Michigan?

     19             A.   Yes, sir.

     20             Q.   And then the one that Ms. Gordon currently

     21        resides in?

     22             A.   Yes, sir.

     23             Q.   Are those the three?

     24             A.   Yes, sir.

     25             Q.   Okay.  And those are the only three you've


                                                                     11


      1        owned in the last five years?

      2             A.   I believe that's correct.

      3             Q.   Okay.  When did you form your company JEBEX RE

      4        Limited (sic)?  Approximation's okay.

      5             A.   2019, 2018.

      6             Q.   Okay.

      7             A.   Well, we can tell from the start of the

      8        mortgage, the Busey mortgage.  That's when it was

      9        started.  So that would be probably '19 I think.

     10             Q.   2019.  All right.  And have you always been

     11        the president --

     12             A.   Yes.

     13             Q.   -- of JEBEX RE Limited?  Does that company

     14        have any employees?

     15             A.   No, sir.

     16             Q.   And is that business registered with the

     17        secretary of state?

     18             A.   Yes, sir.

     19             Q.   Okay.  Referring to the foreclosure property

     20        that's the subject of this action, would you agree that

     21        the foreclosure property that you are currently suing to

     22        foreclose is located at 156 River Mist Drive, Oswego,

     23        Illinois 60543?

     24             A.   Yes, sir.

     25             Q.   Is there any kind of unit number associated


                                                                     12


      1        with that location?

      2             A.   I believe there is on the tax bill, but,

      3        offhand, I don't know what that is.

      4             Q.   Because when I've seen pictures of it, it

      5        looks like it is actually two parts of a building.

      6             A.   It's four parts.

      7             Q.   Four --

      8             A.   There -- there are four unit buildings.

      9             Q.   Okay.  So is there an individual unit

     10        designation for this particular property?

     11             A.   They have individual street addresses.  Even

     12        though it's four buildings inside one, they all have

     13        four individual street addresses.

     14             Q.   Well, they're all at 156 River Mist Drive?

     15             A.   No.

     16             Q.   No.

     17             A.   No.

     18             Q.   They don't.  Okay.  So --

     19             A.   56.

     20             Q.   Gotcha.

     21             A.   154, 15 --

     22             Q.   Okay.  So they branch it out to different

     23        numbers?

     24             A.   Yeah.  Yeah.

     25             Q.   It's not different unit numbers?


                                                                     13


      1             A.   No.

      2             Q.   Okay.

      3             A.   There is a unit number if you look at the tax

      4        bill.

      5             Q.   Okay.

      6             A.   But no one uses it other than the tax bill.

      7             Q.   Okay.  Going forward, if it's all right, I'm

      8        just going to call the location River Mist, make it

      9        simple for everyone if that's all right.

     10                  When did you purchase the River Mist property?

     11             A.   2008, 2009, someplace in there.

     12             Q.   And do you recall what the purchase price was?

     13             A.   300,000.

     14             Q.   And did you ever actually live in that

     15        property yourself?

     16             A.   A number of years.

     17             Q.   Okay.  How many years did you live in the

     18        property would you estimate?

     19             A.   Eight or nine.

     20             Q.   So I'm sorry.  What year did you say you

     21        purchased the property?

     22             A.   I thought it was like 2008.

     23             Q.   Okay.  2008.  All right.  And was that a cash

     24        deal, or did you take a mortgage?

     25             A.   I had a mortgage.


                                                                     14


      1             Q.   Okay.  And you mentioned the purchase price

      2        was 300,000, right?

      3             A.   Yes, sir.

      4             Q.   And you also mentioned that you did live in

      5        the property?

      6             A.   Yes, sir.

      7             Q.   Do you know how long you lived in there for?

      8                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Asked and answered.

      9                  THE DEPONENT:  Asked and answered.

     10        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     11             Q.   Okay.  How many other tenants did you have

     12        live in that building besides Ericka?

     13                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.

     14                  THE DEPONENT:  Objection.

     15                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Characterization of Ericka as a

     16        tenant.

     17                  MR. KHWAJA:  That's fine.

     18        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     19             Q.   Okay.  How many -- how many tenants did you

     20        have live in that building that you rented the property

     21        out to from 2008 to the present?

     22             A.   One renter.

     23             Q.   Okay.  And do you know when that tenant's

     24        lease ended?

     25             A.   I let them out early when Ericka was


                                                                     15


      1        purchasing.

      2                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 1 was marked for

      3        identification.)

      4        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      5             Q.   Okay.  So handing the defendant what's been

      6        marked as Exhibit 1, plaintiff, I meant and handing one

      7        to counsel.

      8                  So I've marked as Exhibit 1 the quitclaim

      9        deed.  What I represent to you is a sale from you to

     10        your company.  Would you disagree with that?

     11             A.   No.

     12             Q.   Okay.  And it appears that this transaction of

     13        the quitclaim from you to your property occurred at or

     14        around January of 2019; is that correct?

     15             A.   Yes, sir.

     16             Q.   Was there a reason that you chose to quitclaim

     17        this property to your company --

     18             A.   Yes.

     19             Q.   -- and not keep it in your individual

     20        capacity?

     21             A.   Uh-huh.

     22             Q.   And what was that reason?

     23             A.   I thought the later financing personally of my

     24        next home would be easier if I didn't have two personal

     25        mortgages.


                                                                     16


      1             Q.   Thought the later financing of my per -- okay.

      2             A.   Future personal home.

      3             Q.   Got it.  Okay.  Did you think if you

      4        transferred the property or company, you'd also have a

      5        better opportunity of obtaining a mortgage?

      6                  Well, you took a mortgage with Busey Bank.  So

      7        did you think that quitclaiming the property from your

      8        individual capacity to JEBEX would put you in a better

      9        position to obtain financing for a mortgage?

     10             A.   Personally?  I don't understand the question.

     11        It's not clear.

     12             Q.   When you took the mortgage with Busey Bank,

     13        you gave a consensual lien against the property?

     14             A.   Are you asking -- who are you asking that

     15        question of, John Bannes or John Bannes, president,

     16        because that question has different meanings according

     17        to who you're talking to?

     18             Q.   Sure.  Well, John Bannes, as president.  Did

     19        you think it would be easier to obtain financing and

     20        secure a mortgage if you used the property located on

     21        River Mist?

     22                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Object to the form of the

     23        question.  And assumes facts that aren't in evidence.

     24                  THE DEPONENT:  The question still doesn't make

     25        sense to me.


                                                                     17


      1        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      2             Q.   The mortgage that you obtained against --

      3             A.   The mortgage that JEXEB obtained for the River

      4        Mist property?

      5             Q.   Correct.

      6             A.   Okay.

      7             Q.   Did you believe that it would be easier to

      8        obtain financing if you did it through your company?

      9             A.   Did I believe JEXEB would have an easier time?

     10             Q.   Would be easier to obtain a mortgage from

     11        Busey Bank, yes?

     12             A.   No, it wasn't.

     13             Q.   Okay.

     14                  THE REPORTER:  If I can just remind everyone

     15        to please speak one at a time.  Please and thank you.

     16                  MR. KHWAJA:  Sure.

     17        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     18             Q.   But you did not -- did you quitclaim the

     19        property to JEBEX in order to obtain a mortgage?

     20             A.   No.

     21             Q.   Okay.  Because I thought that's what you

     22        stated at your earlier testimony.

     23                  MR. KHWAJA:  I'm going to hand the defendant

     24        what's been marked as Exhibit 2.  Exhibit 2 for you, and

     25        Exhibit 2 for your --


                                                                     18


      1                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Busey Bank mortgage?

      2                  MR. KHWAJA:  Yes.

      3                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 2 was marked for

      4        identification.)

      5        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      6             Q.   So do you recognize this mortgage?

      7             A.   Yes.

      8             Q.   And what do you recognize it to be?

      9             A.   The mortgage that JEXEB obtained for the

     10        property.

     11             Q.   And is it fair to say that approximately four

     12        months later, at or around May 20 of 2019, you took this

     13        -- I'm sorry.

     14                  Is it fair to say that four months after

     15        quitclaiming the property to JEBEX you then proceeded by

     16        and through the company to take this mortgage?

     17             A.   Ask again, please.

     18             Q.   Sure.  You quitclaimed the property to JEBEX

     19        in January --

     20             A.   JEXEB.

     21             Q.   JEXEB, correct.  In January of 2019, correct?

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   And four months later you took this mortgage,

     24        correct?

     25             A.   Yes.


                                                                     19


      1             Q.   Okay.  And so can I draw your attention to the

      2        provision that says collect rents on page 9, and it

      3        states:  Lender shall have the right without notice to

      4        borrower or grantor to take possession of the property

      5        and collect the rents including amounts past due,

      6        unpaid, and apply the net proceeds over the above

      7        lender's cost against the indebtedness.

      8                  What did you understand this provision to mean

      9        when you signed the mortgage?

     10             A.   If I don't keep the mortgage current, they

     11        would have a right to whatever rents I'm earning.

     12             Q.   Right.  And did you also understand that if

     13        this mortgage defaulted, Busey Bank would file a

     14        foreclosure?

     15             A.   On the corporation, yes.

     16             Q.   Okay.

     17             A.   I have an 800 plus credit score.  That's not

     18        likely to happen.

     19             Q.   We don't need to get into speculation.  I just

     20        want to know if you understand the documents.

     21                  What was the purpose of the loan with Busey

     22        Bank?  What was the funding for?

     23             A.   This mortgage.

     24             Q.   That's right.  But why did you need the

     25        funding?  What was it for?  Or why -- I'm sorry --


                                                                     20


      1             A.   Pay off -- pay off the personal mortgage that

      2        had been on the property.

      3             Q.   Okay.  So you took this mortgage, and you

      4        borrowed the money to pay off the first mortgage on your

      5        property in Will County?

      6             A.   No.

      7             Q.   Okay.  What property were you paying off?

      8             A.   The River Mist property.

      9             Q.   If you take -- okay.  So you took a mortgage,

     10        had a consensual lien placed against the property, and

     11        you took that mortgage to pay off an existing debt

     12        because you were --

     13             A.   I refinanced.

     14             Q.   Okay.

     15             A.   The corporation refinanced the personal loan.

     16             Q.   Okay.  But you were incurring additional debt

     17        though.  It wasn't being discharged.  You owed money

     18        under the mortgage.  Do you understand that?

     19                  You were borrowing money and taking a

     20        mortgage.  In exchange, they placed a lien against your

     21        property for nonpayment if you didn't pay.  You

     22        understand that, right?

     23             A.   Yes.

     24             Q.   Okay.  And what was the amount that was

     25        borrowed under this mortgage?


                                                                     21


      1             A.   Is it going to say someplace in here?  Three

      2        twenty-two.

      3             Q.   That's actually the maximum lien.  So I do

      4        believe it's a smaller amount.  I just want to know if

      5        you know.  If you don't know --

      6             A.   Off the top of my head, no.  I can look at the

      7        docs.

      8             Q.   Sure.

      9             A.   You want me to look at the docs.

     10             Q.   We'll get to it.  At the time that you took

     11        the mortgage with Busey Bank, was anyone living in the

     12        River Mist property?

     13             A.   I think the renter was there at that time.

     14             Q.   And do you know when the renter actually left

     15        the property?

     16             A.   No, that would be this one.  He still at

     17        property there when Ericka moved in.

     18             Q.   Okay.  I'm just trying to figure out --

     19             A.   But approximately at the time she moved in.

     20             Q.   Okay.  So when do you believe Ericka moved in?

     21             A.   She moved in on her lease on like end of June.

     22             Q.   Okay.

     23             A.   Before the mortgage.

     24             Q.   Okay.  And what is your belief when the prior

     25        tenant moved out?  Sometime around that time?  You don't


                                                                     22


      1        know?

      2             A.   Sometime before then.

      3             Q.   Okay.  So when did you make a decision to sell

      4        the River Mist Drive property?

      5             A.   Unknown.

      6             Q.   Don't have any idea --

      7             A.   It's -- it's -- it's been something I

      8        discussed before, thought of for almost since I lived

      9        there.  I knew I wasn't going to retire there.  It's too

     10        many stairs.

     11             Q.   What year did you purchase the property again?

     12             A.   Like 2008 I think.

     13             Q.   2008.  Right.  So is your characterization

     14        that since you purchased the property in 2008 you had

     15        thoughts about selling it?

     16             A.   Yes.

     17             Q.   Did you actually ever list the property for

     18        sale from 2008 to 2019?  20 -- let's go -- 18?

     19             A.   Yes.  It was listed before the tenant was

     20        there.

     21             Q.   So you did make prior attempts to sell it --

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   -- before meeting Ms. Gordon?

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   Okay.


                                                                     23


      1             A.   It was listed.  I can give you some of the

      2        people who purchased, you know, who made offers.

      3             Q.   Okay.

      4             A.   And rejected.

      5                  THE REPORTER:  What was that?

      6                  THE WITNESS:  And rejected.

      7                  THE REPORTER:  Thank you.

      8        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      9             Q.   So there were purchase offers, but you

     10        rejected them?

     11             A.   Yes, sir.

     12             Q.   Okay.  So let's draw your attention to the

     13        summer of 2020, June, July, the summer of 2020.  Was the

     14        property listed for sale at that time?

     15             A.   Probably.  That's why -- yes.

     16             Q.   Okay.  Do you know what firm or firms you were

     17        working with to sell the property?

     18             A.   Inspire Realty.

     19             Q.   Was that the only one?

     20             A.   Yes, sir.

     21             Q.   And do you know how Inspire Realty had the

     22        advertisement listed on, you know, their websites or

     23        their signs as listed as lease or was it listed as sale?

     24             A.   It was supposed to be listed for both.  I

     25        don't know what they did.


                                                                     24


      1             Q.   You don't know what they did.  Okay.  And are

      2        you familiar with someone by the name of Francine

      3        Blackmond?

      4             A.   Yes.

      5             Q.   Okay.  And --

      6             A.   I don't know that I ever met her.  I am

      7        familiar with her name.

      8             Q.   Well, you were working with Inspire Realty,

      9        right?

     10             A.   Yes.

     11             Q.   And did you --

     12             A.   But my broker was also Inspire Realty.

     13             Q.   Okay.  But did you have a designated realtor

     14        or an agent you spoke with regularly?

     15             A.   Just John Barnak.

     16             Q.   Who is John Barnak?

     17             A.   He is a broker with Inspire.

     18             Q.   Okay.  So --

     19             A.   You will find John Barnak's name on emails.

     20             Q.   Okay.  Sure.  So when you decided to put up

     21        the property for sale or lease, is Mr. Barnak who you

     22        reached out to originally?

     23             A.   Yes.  Well, I don't know about originally.

     24             Q.   Okay.  But you reached out to him?

     25             A.   Right.


                                                                     25


      1             Q.   And did --

      2             A.   He ended up with the listing.

      3             Q.   And did you also have conversations with

      4        Francine Blackmond either in person or on phone?

      5             A.   I do not recall.

      6             Q.   Okay.  When you, you know, reached out to

      7        either Mr. John Barnak or Francine Blackmond to list

      8        your property for sale, did you disclose to the realtors

      9        there was a lien on the property?

     10             A.   I have no recollection.

     11             Q.   Do you think that would have been something

     12        important that you should have advised them?

     13             A.   No.

     14             Q.   And why would that be?

     15             A.   Almost every property in the world has a lien

     16        on it.

     17             Q.   Okay.  So did you think attempting to sale

     18        your property with a lien on it would be a problem?

     19             A.   No.

     20             Q.   And why is that?

     21             A.   Because it's what's done.

     22             Q.   And you acknowledge --

     23             A.   And it's allowed by this mortgage.

     24             Q.   Okay.  But you acknowledge that if you had

     25        nonpayment of that mortgage, the party that was living


                                                                     26


      1        in that house would be foreclosed on?

      2             A.   The JEXEB would be foreclosed on.

      3             Q.   No.  I'm saying the party that was actually

      4        living in the house?

      5             A.   That's your characterization.  JEXEB would

      6        have been foreclosed on, and I would have had to have

      7        gone to my IRA to pay it off.

      8             Q.   But Ms. Gordon was living in the house at the

      9        time of July of 2020?

     10             A.   Immaterial to JEXEB's mortgage.

     11             Q.   Please answer the question.  Ms. Gordon was

     12        living in the house at the time of July of 2020,

     13        correct?

     14             A.   Correct.

     15             Q.   And if that lien went unpaid, the house would

     16        be foreclosed while Ms. Gordon was living in it,

     17        correct?

     18             A.   I do not know.  Why would that they do that?

     19             Q.   For non -- that's how nonpayment works, sir.

     20        You should know.  You're filing a foreclosure.

     21             A.   Yeah, yeah, that's how it works.  But

     22        realistically, they're going to file against JEXEB.

     23             Q.   Well, that's -- that's not how a consensual

     24        lien works.  We don't need to get into an argument.  I

     25        just want to know, do you recognize the nonpayment to


                                                                     27


      1        Busey Bank could result in the foreclosure of the house

      2        while Ms. Gordon lived in there?

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   Thank you.

      5             A.   Illogical but yes.

      6             Q.   Okay.  And you didn't advise -- you did not

      7        advise Francine Blackmond there was a lien against the

      8        property, right?

      9             A.   I never --

     10                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  He's already said

     11        he has no recollection --

     12                  THE DEPONENT:  No recollection of talking to

     13        her.

     14                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  -- of speaking to Francine

     15        Blackmond.

     16        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     17             Q.   Well, we're talking about John Barnak.  We're

     18        talking about Francine.  There's two here so I want to

     19        cover both and make sure that we have?

     20                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  He has clearly identified

     21        Mr. Barnak as his listing agent.

     22                  MR. KHWAJA:  Okay.

     23                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  And only knows the name of

     24        Francine.

     25        BY MR. KHWAJA:


                                                                     28


      1             Q.   Well, let me ask you this next question.  Do

      2        you know if Mr. Barnak or if Ms. Blackmond did a title

      3        search prior to putting your sale for property (sic)?

      4             A.   I have no idea.

      5             Q.   Okay.  So when did you come to hear about

      6        Ms. Gordon's interest in renting your property?

      7             A.   Message came to me that someone was interested

      8        in -- in renting.

      9             Q.   Okay.  And who communicated that message to

     10        you?

     11             A.   I don't recall if it was Francine or John.

     12             Q.   But you believe it would have been one of

     13        them?

     14             A.   One of them contacted me and provided me

     15        contact information for --

     16             Q.   Okay.  And you were provided Ericka's contact

     17        information?

     18             A.   Yes.

     19             Q.   Okay.  And was your first conversation with

     20        Ericka over the phone or in person?

     21             A.   Probably phone, but I --

     22             Q.   Okay.  I'm just --

     23             A.   -- wouldn't say for sure.

     24             Q.   Is there a document you want to produce for

     25        everyone here if you're going to be referring to your


                                                                     29


      1        notes there?

      2             A.   Well, I was just going to look at it.

      3             Q.   And if you're going to start looking at your

      4        notes, sir, you need to produce that for everybody.

      5             A.   Make some copies.  In fact, I've a jump drive

      6        for you if you want to take some stuff.

      7             Q.   Okay.  All right.

      8             A.   May 20th.

      9             Q.   So --

     10             A.   This is a text between Ericka and I.

     11             Q.   Okay.  All right.  So -- so you and Ericka

     12        exchange the text.  Can you tell me what the substance

     13        of the first conversation was to the best of your

     14        recollection?

     15             A.   She had asked about renting.

     16             Q.   Okay.

     17             A.   And the idea was she said she wanted to rent

     18        the property for a year and then purchase it after.

     19             Q.   Okay.

     20             A.   And I asked.

     21             Q.   So she communicated to you that although her

     22        inquiry was about being a renter, she had an interest in

     23        purchasing?

     24             A.   Yes, sir.

     25             Q.   Okay.  And when she told you that she had an


                                                                     30


      1        interest in purchasing, what did you say to the best of

      2        your recollection?

      3             A.   I would have said why would you want to rent

      4        and not generate the equity immediately and purchase

      5        right away.

      6             Q.   Okay.  So essentially you proposed to her that

      7        buying would be more equitable her for?

      8             A.   Yes.

      9             Q.   Is that right?

     10             A.   Yes.

     11             Q.   Okay.  And that was the first conversation in

     12        May.  At that point, had you two come to any kind of

     13        agreement yet or it was still just discussions?

     14             A.   Oh, there's pages of discussion.

     15             Q.   Okay.  So after -- was there several

     16        conversations in May?

     17             A.   May and into -- into June.

     18             Q.   Okay.  So to the best that you can recall, how

     19        did the first conversation in May end?

     20             A.   I can't remember the first conversation.

     21             Q.   If you can't remember, that's fine.  I'm just

     22        saying if you remember how the -- like, hey, she told

     23        you I want to buy it.  I don't want to buy it.  The best

     24        you can remember.

     25             A.   As I even stated --


                                                                     31


      1             Q.   Okay.

      2             A.   -- we talked about wanting to rent but we'll

      3        buy in a year.

      4             Q.   Okay.  So just discussions, nothing formal

      5        yet?

      6             A.   Nothing formal.

      7             Q.   Okay.  Do you know when the next time was you

      8        talked to her?

      9             A.   I would have to look at notes, you know, but

     10        throughout May and June, there are multiple text files

     11        between us.  Multiple emails between us.

     12             Q.   Have you brought any of those today?

     13             A.   I can -- yes.

     14             Q.   Okay.  So do you have an approximation how

     15        many conversations there were whether it was by text or

     16        phone?

     17             A.   I'm going to throw out a wide range of number

     18        between 50 and 100.

     19             Q.   50 to 100?

     20             A.   Yes.

     21             Q.   And prior to signing the note, when would you

     22        say those conversations racked up, like where there was

     23        a formal deal made, without signing, of course, where

     24        you both came to a meeting of the minds?

     25             A.   Probably when the real estate contract was


                                                                     32


      1        signed.

      2             Q.   Okay.  And when do you believe that was?

      3             A.   I can look it up.

      4             Q.   Sure.  You can look it up.

      5             A.   No, not that what.  I'm going to spread it all

      6        out there.

      7                  THE WITNESS:  What's that I hurt his feelings.

      8                  THE REPORTER:  Should we go off the record for

      9        a minute?

     10                  Off the record 1:38 p.m.

     11                  (WHEREUPON, a recess was taken.)

     12                  THE REPORTER:  Back on record at 1:46 p.m.

     13        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     14             Q.   So, Mr. Bannes, it was your testimony that you

     15        believe there was a meeting of the minds when the

     16        contract was signed, right?

     17             A.   Yes.

     18             Q.   And that was June 2nd, 2020 --

     19             A.   Yes, sir.

     20             Q.   -- according to you?  Have you ever produced

     21        this document in the court case?

     22                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.

     23                  MR. KHWAJA:  What's the objection?

     24                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Well, there's been no written

     25        discovery conducted in the court case.


                                                                     33


      1                  MR. KHWAJA:  Okay.

      2                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  So the implication that he's

      3        hidden something --

      4                  MR. KHWAJA:  That's fine.

      5                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  -- I'm objecting to.  There's

      6        been no -- there's been no production of documents by

      7        any party.

      8                  MR. KHWAJA:  Are you instructing him not to

      9        answer?

     10                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  I'm not.

     11        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     12             Q.   Okay.

     13             A.   So what's the question?

     14             Q.   The question is:  Have you ever introduced

     15        this real estate contract into the court case as far as

     16        you know?

     17             A.   No.

     18             Q.   Did you ever produce this contract when anyone

     19        else requested it?

     20             A.   No.  It's another business.

     21             Q.   So do you recall a time where Ms. Gordon

     22        requested this contract?

     23             A.   She had one from Francine.  I didn't think --

     24        I didn't know why she was asking for one if she did.

     25             Q.   So it's your testimony that Ms. Blackmond


                                                                     34


      1        provided Ericka with a real estate contract?

      2             A.   It would be my understanding that would be the

      3        normal process in a real estate transaction, your agent

      4        provides you stuff.

      5             Q.   Okay.  But you don't know that for an actual

      6        fact?

      7             A.   I have no idea for a fact.

      8             Q.   And I believe you testified earlier that she

      9        wasn't your go-to.  It was essentially John who you were

     10        talking to?

     11             A.   I talked to John, yes.

     12             Q.   Okay.  So you do not know one way or the other

     13        whether Ms. Gordon was ever provided this real estate

     14        contract before today?

     15             A.   Other than her signature's on it, no.

     16             Q.   Okay.  And you never directly gave her this

     17        real estate contract, correct?

     18             A.   No.

     19             Q.   So how do you actually know whether she

     20        received it or not?

     21             A.   I don't.

     22             Q.   Okay.

     23             A.   It's a DocuSign.  She signed it, I think,

     24        electronically, didn't she?

     25             Q.   This is the first time I've seen this so I


                                                                     35


      1        don't have the time to go through all of this today, but

      2        we'll be following up on it.

      3                  So in June when there was a meeting of the

      4        minds, did you have any discussion regarding what

      5        repairs were needed for the house?

      6             A.   Absolutely.

      7             Q.   And can you give me the summary of what that

      8        conversation essentially was?  For instance, let me

      9        rephrase it.  Repairs that were needed in the house,

     10        what was the arrangement as to who would pay for the

     11        repairs and how that would be split?  If Ericka had

     12        inspected the house --

     13             A.   I think post purchase or before purchase?

     14             Q.   Before purchase.

     15             A.   Before purchase?

     16             Q.   Correct.

     17             A.   JEXEB took care of a bunch of stuff.

     18             Q.   Okay.  So can you give me an -- what month and

     19        year are we referring to?

     20             A.   During June.

     21             Q.   Okay.  So during June of 2022, prior to

     22        closing, you are stating that some repairs were made in

     23        the house?

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   Can you just give me an idea of what some of


                                                                     36


      1        those were?

      2             A.   The garage door was part of the issue with the

      3        inspector that Ericka had hired.

      4             Q.   Okay.

      5             A.   And I had a garage door company out.  They

      6        inspected it.  I have the receipt if you'd like to see

      7        it.  It says the garage door was fine.

      8             Q.   For now, I just want a summary of what you

      9        think was done.

     10             A.   Okay.

     11             Q.   Okay.  So the garage roller was repaired you

     12        say, right?

     13             A.   No.  No.  Nothing needed repair.  Receipt

     14        shows only needed lubrication.  Door checks out fine.

     15             Q.   Okay.  What were the other action items that

     16        needed to be repaired potentially and discussed between

     17        you and Ericka?

     18             A.   The inspector decided something might be up

     19        with the air conditioner.  We had the air conditioning

     20        looked at and repaired.  Spent 300 and something dollars

     21        for air conditioner repair.

     22             Q.   Okay.  And what other --

     23             A.   The homeowners association required the deck

     24        to be restained.

     25             Q.   Hang on one second.


                                                                     37


      1             A.   And it was.

      2             Q.   So we have lubrication for the garage door?

      3             A.   Inspection and lubrication.

      4             Q.   Inspection and lubrication.  And you state

      5        that the air conditioner was repaired?

      6             A.   Air conditioner was repaired.  One of the

      7        other pieces on the jump drive is the receipt from Top

      8        AC who did that repair.

      9             Q.   Okay.  Any other action items that were dealt

     10        with preclosing?

     11             A.   Carpets were cleaned.

     12             Q.   Okay.  Anything else?

     13             A.   There was another one that escapes me right

     14        now.

     15             Q.   Okay.  So that was preclosing.  Did you and

     16        Ericka then have like a walk-through again through the

     17        house --

     18             A.   Yes.

     19             Q.   -- to determine --

     20             A.   There were lights that were out that I fixed.

     21             Q.   Okay.

     22             A.   There was a -- the inspector had a problem

     23        with the kitchen stove not having an anti-tip device.

     24             Q.   Okay.

     25             A.   There were a number of things that were walk


                                                                     38


      1        through and we discussed that they were repaired.

      2             Q.   Okay.  And so you conveyed to Ms. Gordon after

      3        the walk-through all the action items that had been

      4        repaired?

      5             A.   Yes.

      6             Q.   And do you recall what Ms. Gordon said to you?

      7        Was she satisfied?  Did she have additional concerns?

      8             A.   I'm not sure what that means.

      9             Q.   Well, I'm sure you know if you've been privy

     10        to the pleadings filed in this case, Ms. Gordon alleges

     11        that there was numerous repairs that needed to be done

     12        and that she had to make a payment for.  So I'm trying

     13        to determine what agreements you both came to prior to

     14        the signing of the note.

     15             A.   We discussed the fact that things could happen

     16        after the fact.

     17             Q.   Okay.

     18             A.   And we would talk about it.

     19             Q.   What did Ericka say to you after you told her

     20        the repairs that were done and, you know, she walked

     21        through the house?

     22             A.   I have no idea.

     23             Q.   Well, do you recall if she was satisfied --

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   She was satisfied?


                                                                     39


      1             A.   She signed the mortgage after -- you know,

      2        after that.

      3             Q.   Okay.  And just --

      4             A.   I've been taking that as meaning that.

      5             Q.   Okay.

      6             A.   I can't say what she said.

      7             Q.   You're speculating.

      8             A.   Yes.

      9             Q.   I understand.  So can you tell me, again, what

     10        was the substance of the agreement for repairs going

     11        forward after the signing of the note?

     12             A.   We talked about it.

     13             Q.   So there was no formal agreement?  You didn't

     14        say to her:  If something breaks, I'll pay 50/50.  There

     15        wasn't any type of items discussed in the house that

     16        needed further repair that were subject to agreement?

     17             A.   One -- one item was discussed that's never

     18        come back up again.

     19             Q.   Okay.  That was?

     20             A.   The thermal seal broken on a few of the

     21        windows.

     22             Q.   Okay.  And --

     23             A.   I had repaired a number of them.

     24             Q.   Okay.

     25             A.   Not all of them were repaired.


                                                                     40


      1             Q.   And it is your testimony at or around the time

      2        of the signing of the note in July of 2020, Ericka had

      3        not conveyed to you that there were any other repairs in

      4        the house that needed to be done?

      5             A.   Yes.

      6             Q.   Okay.  During this discussion with Ericka, did

      7        you disclose to her that there was a lien against the

      8        property with Busey Bank?

      9             A.   Yes.

     10             Q.   You told her there was a lien?

     11             A.   Again, I'm going to produce a document.  We

     12        had a discussion about how much the mortgage rate would

     13        be.

     14             Q.   Uh-huh.

     15             A.   And, originally, I proposed a 6 percent loan

     16        rate.

     17             Q.   Okay.

     18             A.   And she thought that was a little high.  And I

     19        said:  Well, I wasn't going to provide -- here's the 6

     20        percent rate.  The lowest I was going to go was five

     21        seventy-five, a half a point over what the corporation's

     22        mortgage was on the property.

     23             Q.   So --

     24             A.   These transactions took place in May.

     25             Q.   So it's your testimony here today that in May


                                                                     41


      1        of 2020 you advised Ms. Gordon that there was an

      2        existing encumbrance on the property in the form of a

      3        lien --

      4             A.   The corporation had a loan on the property and

      5        would not write the loan for less than what the

      6        corporation was going to pay on its note.

      7             Q.   And when you conveyed to her that there was an

      8        existing lien on the property, what did she say?

      9             A.   I don't recall.

     10             Q.   You recall telling her about the lien, but you

     11        don't recall what she said in response?

     12             A.   I don't recall what she said specifically, no.

     13        She went ahead with the loan.

     14             Q.   Do you have any proof by way of email,

     15        actually in a written message or something more formal,

     16        conveying to her that there was an existing lien on the

     17        property?

     18             A.   I could look through the text.  We could look

     19        through email some more, I suppose.

     20             Q.   Wouldn't you agree that it would be a bit odd

     21        for someone to buy a house --

     22             A.   No.

     23             Q.   -- that had another mortgage on it for

     24        somebody else?

     25             A.   No.


                                                                     42


      1             Q.   Really?

      2             A.   No.

      3             Q.   Because they could be foreclosed for

      4        nonpayment?

      5             A.   No.

      6             Q.   You thought that was completely normal?

      7             A.   Yes, sir.  Businesses do it all the time.  Big

      8        corporations don't own the properties they rent out.

      9             Q.   So what did you tell her the dollar amount was

     10        of the lien attached to her property that she's about to

     11        purchase?

     12             A.   I don't believe I discussed the amount.

     13             Q.   You simply told her there was a lien?

     14             A.   I showed her that I wasn't going to write a

     15        loan for less than the percentage the corporation was

     16        paying.

     17             Q.   And you don't remember what her response was

     18        to that?

     19             A.   I don't recall.

     20             Q.   So you convey to Ms. Gordon that there's a

     21        lien on the property, but you didn't tell any of the

     22        realtors at Inspire Realty you were working with there

     23        was a lien?

     24                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.

     25                  MR. KHWAJA:  What's the objection?


                                                                     43


      1                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  I believe it misstates his

      2        testimony.

      3                  MR. KHWAJA:  Well, I don't think it does.  He

      4        said --

      5        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      6             Q.   So to clarify, you never communicated to

      7        Inspire Realty there was a lien on the property, right?

      8             A.   I don't recall.

      9             Q.   But even though they were the ones selling it

     10        for you?

     11             A.   It's immaterial.

     12             Q.   It's hardly immaterial, sir.

     13             A.   It's immaterial.  Properties are sold all the

     14        time that have at least one loan and usually, often, two

     15        loans.

     16             Q.   It's not immaterial, sir.

     17             A.   It's my testimony.  It's immaterial.

     18             Q.   So but you do not recall whether you told

     19        Inspire Realty when they went to sell your property

     20        advising there was an encumbrance or lien on it.  You

     21        don't recall?

     22             A.   Don't recall.

     23             Q.   But you do recall telling her about it?

     24             A.   Because of this document.

     25             Q.   What -- what is this document, sir?


                                                                     44


      1             A.   This document is where I was producing loan

      2        values, loan prices, how much -- how much her payment

      3        was going to be before she was buying the property.

      4             Q.   This is simply telling her though what she's

      5        going to pay.  Identify for me on this document where it

      6        states there's a lien and the value of the lien?

      7             A.   It doesn't.

      8             Q.   That's right.  Okay.

      9             A.   But you asked when I first talked about it,

     10        and it shows that.

     11             Q.   How did you come to decide -- well, what was

     12        the down payment that you and Ericka discussed for the

     13        house?

     14             A.   She originally offered 5,000.

     15             Q.   Okay.

     16             A.   I started doing the calculations at 5,000.  I

     17        thought it was a little too light, and I asked her to go

     18        to 10,000.

     19             Q.   Okay.  And when you asked her to go to 10,000,

     20        did she advise you she couldn't afford that?

     21             A.   She said she thought she could get to seven,

     22        but she thought ten might be tough.

     23             Q.   Okay.  And did you come up with creative

     24        solutions to raise that 10,000 for her?

     25             A.   I asked her if she thought what other options


                                                                     45


      1        there might be.  She mentioned she had multiple cars.  I

      2        said, well, you know, maybe we could -- maybe I could

      3        have someone buy her car.

      4             Q.   But wasn't it you, in fact, sir, who bought

      5        her car?

      6             A.   I did not buy her.  There's no documents with

      7        JEXEB or John Bannes on her titles.

      8             Q.   Her purchased the car, sir?

      9             A.   Karen Bannes.

     10             Q.   So this is a family member?

     11             A.   Yes, I persuaded my sister to get involved in

     12        my business.

     13             Q.   So you had a family member purchase the car --

     14             A.   Yes, sir.

     15             Q.   -- to help raise the 10,000 to purchase the

     16        property?

     17             A.   Yes, sir.

     18             Q.   Did you find this a little bit aggressive --

     19             A.   No.

     20             Q.   -- that you needed to sell the property that

     21        badly?

     22             A.   No, sir.

     23             Q.   Why did you decide to -- well, let me give you

     24        another exhibit.

     25                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 3 was marked for


                                                                     46


      1        identification.)

      2        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      3             Q.   So I'm going to ask you about what's been

      4        marked as Exhibit 3 for identification purposes.

      5                  THE REPORTER:  I'll just take this.  No, not

      6        that.  Just this.

      7                  MR. KHWAJA:  I'll give one to your attorney,

      8        one to you.

      9                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Exhibit 3 is two pages?

     10                  MR. KHWAJA:  Yes.

     11                  THE DEPONENT:  Yes.

     12                  MR. KHWAJA:  Yes, it is.

     13        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     14             Q.   Mr. Bannes, is your email

     15        JBannes@SBCglobal.net?

     16             A.   Yes, sir.

     17             Q.   And is that a usual and customary email?

     18             A.   That's pretty much the only one I use.

     19             Q.   Do you generally open your emails the day that

     20        they're received?

     21             A.   Yes, sir.

     22             Q.   And is this a communication from you to

     23        Ms. Gordon's attorney advising Ms. Gordon's attorney

     24        that you've been advised not to produce the real estate

     25        contract?


                                                                     47


      1             A.   Yes, sir.

      2             Q.   Okay.  And would you agree that at the next

      3        page there's a communication from Lauren Jackson,

      4        Ms. Gordon's attorney, stating:  John, my last question

      5        to you of whether there was a signed contract for the

      6        purchase of the property was never answered.  Did Ericka

      7        Gordon sign a contract to purchase this property from

      8        you or not?

      9                  You refused to answer this question, correct?

     10             A.   Yes, sir.

     11             Q.   Can you tell me why you refused to answer it?

     12             A.   Because of all of Lauren Jackson's questions

     13        regarded -- were of the tone that there was something

     14        wrong with the contract and not regarding refinancing.

     15        She never asked or requested a payoff amount or anything

     16        relating to refinancing.

     17             Q.   But wouldn't you agree that the real estate

     18        contract --

     19             A.   No, sir.

     20             Q.   You didn't even hear my question yet.

     21                  THE REPORTER:  Can you please wait until he's

     22        finished with his question.

     23                  THE DEPONENT:  I'm sorry.

     24        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     25             Q.   Wouldn't you agree that the real estate


                                                                     48


      1        contract is part of the loan document package that's

      2        very important --

      3             A.   No, sir.

      4             Q.   -- whether it is going to be to refinance or

      5        to sell the property?  You think it has no importance?

      6             A.   No importance.  Once a property, once a

      7        mortgage exists, the only thing -- the only document I

      8        wanted downloaded off the web, once a loan exists, all

      9        that's required is the borrower's information and a

     10        payoff amount.

     11             Q.   But if there is nothing in the real estate

     12        contract that is incorrect or inaccurate, why wouldn't

     13        you just produce it?

     14             A.   Not my business to do other people's

     15        paperwork.

     16             Q.   But this is Ms. Gordon's attorney who is

     17        now --

     18             A.   Who is not representing -- was not, sorry, was

     19        not asking for a payoff.

     20             Q.   But all these documents were relevant.

     21             A.   No, sir.

     22             Q.   Well, they were.

     23                  But you do recognize that Lauren Jackson was

     24        Ms. Gordon's attorney, correct?  And you recognize that

     25        Ms. Gordon was the buyer of the house, correct?


                                                                     49


      1             A.   Yes, sir.

      2             Q.   And you recognize that Ms. Jackson was asking

      3        for the real estate contract on behalf of Ms. Gordon?

      4             A.   No, sir.

      5             Q.   Well, who was she asking it on behalf of?

      6             A.   I don't know that.

      7             Q.   But you -- and you acknowledge you refused to

      8        produce it?

      9             A.   Yes, sir because it was available to her from

     10        other sources.

     11             Q.   Her lawyer was asking on her behalf to produce

     12        the contract.  Where was she supposed to obtain it from?

     13             A.   The client should get it from -- should have

     14        it in her own documents, and if she doesn't, then she

     15        (sic) should be available from her real estate agent.

     16             Q.   Are you aware that Ms. Gordon was never

     17        provided the real estate contract?

     18             A.   I have no idea if that's true or not.

     19             Q.   Okay.  But in light of the fact that it could

     20        be true, don't you think --

     21             A.   It could be true.  I can't answer it.

     22             Q.   Don't you think it would just make logical

     23        sense to turn over the contract to the buyer of the

     24        property?

     25             A.   No, sir.

      3        identification.)

      4        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      5             Q.   I'm going to hand what's been marked as

      6        Exhibit 4 for identification.  So did you ever speak to

      7        a Kim Grant, a realtor?

      8             A.   Never, sir.

      9             Q.   Okay.  Did you ever speak with Dean

     10        Kloronomous?

     11             A.   Yes, by text, by email.

     12             Q.   Okay.  And isn't it true that Mr. Kloronomous

     13        requested the real estate contract from you?

     14             A.   Mr. Kloronomous requested a payoff, and he

     15        received it.

     16             Q.   But isn't it also true that he requested the

     17        real estate contract?

     18             A.   I don't recall that.

     19             Q.   Well, if you can -- I'll read the message, the

     20        text message here, which I represent is between Kim

     21        Grant, the realtor, and Ms. Gordon.

     22                  It states:  Hi there.  I spoke with Dean.

     23        He's still not getting a copy of your contract or

     24        settlement statement.  John is saying he's been advised

     25        not to provide that.  I reached out to Francine


                                                                     51


      1        Blackmond, who was listed as the buyer's agent who

      2        assisted you to get these items.  Her brokerage is

      3        required to keep these for seven years.  If she doesn't

      4        provide them, I recommend you contact the managing

      5        broker for the company.  At any rate, John is saying the

      6        mortgage payoff would be 291.

      7                  But, again, there's this conversation here

      8        that John is saying he's been advised not to provide

      9        that.  So you're being requested documents from a

     10        realtor, realty, and you refuse to provide them; is that

     11        correct?

     12             A.   I provided a mortgage payoff.

     13             Q.   But were you requested the real estate

     14        contract?

     15             A.   I don't recall.  I don't -- I've never had a

     16        conversation with Kim Grant.

     17             Q.   I understand.  But are you denying this

     18        conversation occurred between you and Dean?

     19             A.   I don't recall him requesting the real estate

     20        contract.

     21             Q.   Okay.  So it is your testimony today that you

     22        do not recall Mr. Dean Kloronomous requesting the real

     23        estate contract from you?

     24             A.   Correct.

      1        identification.)

      2        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      3             Q.   Okay.  Let's go to Exhibit 5.  I'm going to

      4        hand you what I represent to be Exhibit 5, which is

      5        JEBEX Realty Limited's complaint of foreclosed mortgage.

      6        He didn't want it?

      7             A.   He didn't want it.

      8             Q.   Okay.  All right.

      9                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  I don't need it.

     10        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     11             Q.   All right.  So I want to draw your attention

     12        to the promissory note in this case.  Installment note.

     13        So according to the terms of the note, there was to be

     14        24 consecutive payments of twenty-five ninety-four

     15        seventy-four followed by a balloon payment of

     16        266,086.92.

     17                  Do you recall those terms, Mr. Bannes?

     18             A.   Yes, sir.

     19             Q.   Okay.  Why is it that you decided to set up

     20        the mortgage in such a way that it would have a balloon

     21        payment only two years later?

     22             A.   Because the mortgage I provided was a bridge

     23        mortgage for Ericka to repair her credit and move in to

     24        a conventional mortgage in 13 months.  There was no need

     25        for it to go 24 months.  She needed to make 12 on-time


                                                                     53


      1        payments, and not doing that precluded her doing the

      2        automatic refinance that had been pre-setup for her.

      3             Q.   Did Ericka state to you that she had credit

      4        issues that needed rebuilding?

      5             A.   Absolutely.  I've got her credit report here.

      6             Q.   Okay.  And did she make the 12 consecutive

      7        payments?

      8             A.   No, sir.

      9             Q.   She never made 12 payments at any time?

     10             A.   Consecutive, on-time payments, no, sir.

     11             Q.   So are you saying --

     12             A.   April payment of '21 was never finished.  Half

     13        a payment was made.

     14             Q.   Okay.  So the first 24 months that were to be

     15        made, you're saying the first year she didn't even do

     16        that?

     17             A.   Didn't make 12 on-time payments, no, sir.

     18             Q.   Okay.  But didn't you have --

     19             A.   You want to see documentation?

     20             Q.   No, not yet.

     21             A.   Okay.

     22             Q.   Didn't you have your representative contact

     23        Ms. Gordon about refinance?

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   Well --


                                                                     54


      1             A.   Not my representative.

      2             Q.   You had some representative?

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   Can you tell me who that name was again?

      5             A.   Mike Reddy.  He was working for Preferred Rate

      6        Mortgage at that time.

      7             Q.   Okay.

      8             A.   And his team credit repair people talked to

      9        Ericka, I understand.  I don't know that for a fact.

     10             Q.   Why did you have Mike Reddy of Preferred

     11        Mortgage contact Ericka for refinance if, per the terms

     12        of your own company's contract, she didn't make 12

     13        payments in a row?

     14             A.   It was done before this transaction even

     15        happened.  She was -- Mike Reddy was involved, again,

     16        making sure that Ericka understood 12 monthly payments

     17        bought her an automatic refinance.

     18             Q.   So you're telling me --

     19             A.   This mortgage should have only run 13 months.

     20             Q.   So you're telling me Mike Reddy contacted

     21        Ericka --

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   -- at the time the note was signed?

     24             A.   Yes, before the note was signed.

     25             Q.   So there was already discussions about --


                                                                     55


      1             A.   Yes.

      2             Q.   -- refinance --

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   -- before the contract had even started?

      5             A.   Yes.

      6                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  John, let him finish the

      7        question.

      8                  THE DEPONENT:  Yes.

      9                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  So she -- don't make her job

     10        harder than it is.  Okay?

     11                  THE DEPONENT:  Yes, I'm sorry.  I knew I was

     12        doing it.

     13                  THE REPORTER:  Thank you.

     14                  THE DEPONENT:  I just can't stop.  They're

     15        short answers at least.

     16        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     17             Q.   So was there any point then that you had Mike

     18        Reddy or any other representative for any mortgage

     19        lender contact Ms. Gordon after July of 2020?

     20             A.   I wouldn't have had another mortgage lender.

     21        I don't believe so.

     22             Q.   Okay.  So leading up to the signing of the

     23        note on July 6, 2020, are you aware that Ms. Gordon did

     24        not have an attorney?

     25             A.   Yes.


                                                                     56


      1             Q.   Did you tell her that your attorney would

      2        handle the paperwork?

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   Did you tell her not to hire her own attorney?

      5             A.   No, sir.

      6             Q.   So at no time did you say don't hire your own

      7        attorney.  My attorney will handle it.  Things will get

      8        messy.

      9             A.   Not what I said.

     10             Q.   Not what you said.  Can you tell me exactly

     11        what you did say?

     12             A.   My -- I said that my experience with real

     13        estate attorneys was such that they each want to put

     14        their own spin on any contract so that they're -- when

     15        they get a contract, there'll be a delay.  And if you're

     16        in a hurry, adding an attorney will add time to the

     17        closing.  And --

     18             Q.   Can you repeat that last part?  So do you

     19        represent this to be your own personal note, sir?

     20             A.   No.  This is an email between Ericka and I --

     21             Q.   Uh-huh.

     22             A.   -- about her need to get into the house sooner

     23        than the mortgage is going to get signed, the lease that

     24        she signed, so that I could let her in the house sooner.

     25             Q.   Okay.  But this doesn't have anything to do


                                                                     57


      1        with our conversation that we're discussing right now?

      2             A.   Yes, it does.

      3             Q.   How is it relevant?

      4             A.   Because if she was in this hurry to move in,

      5        adding another lawyer to the transaction would have

      6        added more time because my personal experience had been

      7        that a lawyer, real estate attorney, is going to want to

      8        make a change, and it's going to take time for things to

      9        go through channels.

     10                  If you need to move quickly, adding in another

     11        attorney is going to delay your close, going to delay

     12        your moving in.  That was the gist of my conversation

     13        with Ericka.

     14             Q.   When you told her that her -- your attorney

     15        would handle everything, did you understood that --

     16                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  Again, it misstates

     17        his testimony.  His testimony was that the attorney

     18        would prepare the paperwork.

     19                  MR. KHWAJA:  Okay.

     20        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     21             Q.   When you stated that your attorney would

     22        prepare the paperwork, did you -- and you told -- let's

     23        restart here.

     24                  Did you communicate to Ms. Gordon your

     25        attorney would handle the paperwork process?


                                                                     58


      1             A.   Yes.

      2             Q.   And did you also understand that to mean that

      3        any complications with respect to the provisions in the

      4        contract the lawyer would explain to her?

      5             A.   I don't know what that means exactly.

      6             Q.   Well, you stated that your lawyer will handle

      7        it.  And do you acknowledge she didn't hire her own

      8        lawyer, correct?

      9             A.   Yeah.

     10             Q.   And would it be a fair statement that she did

     11        not hire her own lawyer based on your representation

     12        your lawyer will handle the paperwork?

     13                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  Calls for

     14        speculation.

     15                  THE DEPONENT:  You're asking me to guess.

     16        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     17             Q.   Okay.  But you recognize that Ms. Gordon

     18        doesn't have any legal training or experience with

     19        contracts, right?

     20             A.   Can I refer to deposition previously?

     21             Q.   Don't look to your lawyer.  Answer the

     22        question.

     23             A.   I'm asking you a question.  Can I refer to

     24        deposition given previously?

     25             Q.   She hasn't -- I mean do you -- no.  We're


                                                                     59


      1        referring to a very specific period of time in the

      2        summer of 2020 leading up to the signing of the note.

      3        Would you agree that Ms. Gordon didn't have any training

      4        in contracts or reading of contracts?

      5             A.   I have no idea.

      6             Q.   Well, are you aware that she's an airline

      7        stewardess?

      8             A.   Previous testimony is that she was trained as

      9        a paralegal.

     10             Q.   Okay.  Are you aware that she's -- okay.  When

     11        did she tell you she was a paralegal?

     12             A.   Deposition held last week.

     13             Q.   Did she ever communicate to you that she

     14        understands legal contracts and she was fine reading

     15        them on her own?

     16             A.   No.

     17             Q.   Okay.

     18             A.   But she didn't -- in the converse, she didn't

     19        complain she wasn't.

     20             Q.   Okay.  At the closing on July 6, 2020, do you

     21        remember where that was located at?

     22             A.   I -- I believe it was, you know --

     23             Q.   Was it Galgan?

     24             A.   -- Galgan's office.  I believe it was Galgan's

     25        office, but I wouldn't guarantee it.


                                                                     60


      1             Q.   Okay.  Can you tell me who you remember being

      2        present at the closing?

      3             A.   Ericka and her mother and someone from

      4        Galgan's office and myself.  But I think there was more

      5        than that.  I thought Mike was there.  But Mike Reddy

      6        said he was not.

      7             Q.   Okay.  You remember at least four people

      8        there.  Why would Mike Reddy be there?

      9             A.   Because he was party of the agreement before.

     10        Because this was all about structuring a loan for Ericka

     11        for 13 months from now, that day.

     12             Q.   But that loan was never restructured.  So why

     13        was --

     14             A.   We didn't know payments were not going to be

     15        made on time.

     16             Q.   Okay.  So you recall --

     17             A.   At that time, the expectation was the payments

     18        were being made.

     19             Q.   So you recall that Ericka and her mother were

     20        there, as well as you.  And then who else did you

     21        identify?

     22             A.   Probably someone from Galgan's office, but I

     23        don't --I don't recall.

     24             Q.   Okay.

     25             A.   Someone from Galgan's office had to be there.


                                                                     61


      1             Q.   Did you have a person -- I mean, you told

      2        Ericka that your attorneys would handle this paperwork.

      3        So you had some kind of relationship with a lawyer at

      4        that office, correct?

      5             A.   Bob Galgan has done other contracts for me.

      6             Q.   Okay.  And was Bob Galgan there that day?

      7             A.   I don't recall if Bob was there or one of his

      8        staffers.

      9             Q.   Do you recall if a lawyer was even there?

     10             A.   I -- I don't recall.

     11             Q.   Okay.  And in light of the fact that you don't

     12        recall, is it fair to say that at the closing you don't

     13        recall anyone explaining what some of these documents

     14        meant to Ericka?

     15             A.   I don't recall Ericka asking.

     16             Q.   She's unrepresented by counsel.  You agree?

     17             A.   I agree.  But I don't recall her asking.

     18             Q.   What was the set up of the documents?  Were

     19        they on the table --

     20             A.   I don't recall.

     21             Q.   -- or was one being presented one by one?

     22             A.   You know, I've done so many closings, I don't

     23        recall.

     24             Q.   Okay.  How many closings have you done?

     25             A.   I've done -- I'm one of the only few people in


                                                                     62


      1        the world who ever had to do a dry one where the

      2        mortgage company refused to fund it.  I do not know.

      3             Q.   So you don't recall how the paperwork was set

      4        up --

      5             A.   No, sir.

      6             Q.   -- or what was handed to her?

      7                  Do you recall what documents were actually

      8        produced at closing?

      9             A.   Closing statement, mortgage, promissory note,

     10        deed.

     11             Q.   What about the real estate contract?

     12             A.   It wouldn't be normally there at closing.

     13             Q.   Okay.  But you don't know or --

     14             A.   I don't know.  You asked me what I remembered.

     15             Q.   Right.  You said closing mortgage -- the

     16        mortgage statement, the mortgage, the note.  What else

     17        do you recall?

     18             A.   The deed.

     19             Q.   The deed.

     20             A.   Uh-hun.

     21             Q.   Anything else?

     22             A.   I don't remember what I said now.

     23             Q.   Okay.  Well, I do.  But at no time was there

     24        ever an explanation to Ericka about these documents?

     25             A.   I don't recall one.


                                                                     63


      1             Q.   Okay.

      2             A.   But I don't know everything that was said at

      3        that thing.  There were multiple people there.

      4             Q.   You mentioned her mother was there.  Do you

      5        remember her mother asking any questions?

      6             A.   I don't remember what people asked and what

      7        people said.

      8             Q.   Do you remember if her mother was sitting next

      9        to her?

     10             A.   I believe she was, but I don't recall that.

     11             Q.   Okay.  And you are not certain whether a

     12        lawyer actually attended this closing?

     13             A.   No.

     14             Q.   Okay.  So who was presenting these documents?

     15        Who do you recall, male or female?

     16             A.   Don't recall.  Most of Bob's staff is female,

     17        but I don't recall.

     18             Q.   What do you recall regarding any title policy

     19        regarding this -- the property?

     20             A.   We talked about a title policy.  I don't

     21        recall more than that, really.

     22             Q.   So you don't know if one was presented at the

     23        closing?

     24             A.   I do not know.

     25             Q.   Okay.  So Ms. Gordon has testified that she


                                                                     64


      1        tried to refinance this mortgage on her own.  Are you

      2        aware of that?

      3             A.   I've seen the testimony, yes.

      4             Q.   And are you aware that she tried to refinance

      5        with Pinpoint Mortgage?

      6             A.   No, sir.  Never contacted me.

      7             Q.   Well, are you aware, based on her testimony,

      8        that she tried to refinance with Pinpoint?

      9             A.   Yes.

     10             Q.   And are you aware, based on her testimony,

     11        that she tried to refinance with Market?

     12             A.   Yes.

     13             Q.   And are you aware that she tried to refinance

     14        with Guaranteed Rate?

     15             A.   Yes.

     16             Q.   Did any of those individual mortgage lenders

     17        contact you directly for document production?

     18             A.   No, sir.

     19             Q.   Okay.  Did Ms. Gordon contact you directly for

     20        document production for refinance?

     21             A.   No, sir.  No one -- the people who asked for a

     22        payoff payment were granted it, were given it.

     23             Q.   But I'm asking a specific question.  With

     24        respect to any of those lenders --

     25             A.   Those lenders never requested payoff


                                                                     65


      1        documentation.

      2             Q.   But did Ericka request documentation from

      3        you --

      4             A.   No.

      5             Q.   -- regarding the loan?  Not once?

      6             A.   Never for payoff amounts, no.

      7             Q.   But did she request other loan documents

      8        related to the mortgage?

      9             A.   What other document is there?

     10             Q.   Settlement statement.  There could be a number

     11        of documents that they want for refinance to look at.

     12             A.   They don't need any of those documents.  They

     13        need --

     14             Q.   Well, sir, it's not your legal opinion what is

     15        needed or what's not needed?

     16             A.   It's not my legal opinion.  It's what I read

     17        on the web.

     18             Q.   I'm asking you --

     19             A.   Yes.

     20             Q.   -- whether she requested certain documents be

     21        produced for the lender and whether you produced them or

     22        not.

     23             A.   I don't recall her asking me for legal

     24        documents relating to refinancing.

     25             Q.   So there's not an email conversation or a


                                                                     66


      1        phone conversation where she requested documents from

      2        you to refinance with one of these lenders?

      3             A.   No, sir.

      4             Q.   Not once?

      5             A.   I don't believe so.  I don't recall one.

      6             Q.   You did not actually get the lease on the

      7        Busey -- or you did not get the Busey Bank lien released

      8        until June of 2022, correct?

      9             A.   It was paid off in May.

     10             Q.   So we'll say at or around June of '22, would

     11        you agree with that?

     12             A.   Would it take a month after?

     13             Q.   Yeah, it can be slow.  Okay.  So you would

     14        agree that at or around June of '22 is when the lien was

     15        released?

     16             A.   Okay.

     17             Q.   And the lien was released two years after the

     18        loan that Ms. Gordon took with JEBEX.  Would you agree

     19        with that?

     20             A.   JEXEB.

     21             Q.   JEXEB.  Sorry.  Would you agree with that?

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   Okay.

     24             A.   Lien was released when I had funds from

     25        selling the property in Michigan.


                                                                     67


      1             Q.   And did Ms. Gordon ever tell you that the lien

      2        on the property was preventing her from selling it?

      3             A.   I'd heard that, but it made no sense to me.  I

      4        heard that testimony.  I don't know that I heard that --

      5        I heard that in document -- in court documentation.  I

      6        don't think she ever communicated --

      7             Q.   Let me give you a scenario, sir.  Some people

      8        have a first and second mortgage on their property?

      9             A.   Yes, sir.

     10             Q.   And when they sell their house those mortgages

     11        get paid?

     12             A.   Yes, sir.

     13             Q.   But if she went to sell her property, she

     14        would be paying off the mortgage with you and the

     15        mortgage that you took out?

     16             A.   Yes, sir.

     17             Q.   Do you understand how that's problematic?

     18             A.   No.  It's the same thing.

     19             Q.   It is absolutely not because did Ericka sign

     20        the mortgage and note with Busey Bank?

     21             A.   No, corporation did.

     22             Q.   So why would she be obligated to pay that

     23        encumbrance --

     24             A.   She wouldn't.

     25             Q.   -- when she sold the property?  Yes, she


                                                                     68


      1        would.

      2             A.   Corporation pays that encumbrance.

      3             Q.   If the house has gone to sale, the liens that

      4        would have been paid were yours that you had with

      5        Ericka?

      6             A.   Yes.

      7             Q.   And then the Busey Bank?

      8             A.   Yes.

      9             Q.   So she would have been stuck paying a debt

     10        that you had taken.  Do you understand that to be true?

     11             A.   It's the normal course of refinancing a loan,

     12        yes.

     13             Q.   And her having to pay the encumbrance of your

     14        debt on her property would cut into her equity.  Do you

     15        understand that to be true?

     16             A.   No.

     17             Q.   Why would it not?

     18             A.   Equity has nothing to do with the other loans.

     19        Equity is the balance -- no.

     20             Q.   Equity --

     21             A.   No.

     22             Q.   -- is the amount of money or value of your

     23        property above and beyond the mortgages.

     24             A.   Right.  The total of her mortgage was what she

     25        owed JEXEB.  It was not a total of what she owed JEXEB


                                                                     69


      1        and what JEXEB owed the corporate -- Bus -- Busey.  It

      2        did not -- was not presented that way.  Never.

      3             Q.   So you don't understand that to me in that if

      4        she went and sold her property, let's say, it's worth

      5        400,000?

      6             A.   Yes.

      7             Q.   She would have to pay off your mortgage that

      8        she took individually from you?

      9             A.   Yes.

     10             Q.   And from JEB -- or and from Busey Bank eating

     11        into the equity of her property.  She would take on a

     12        debt that she did not borrow.  Do you understand that?

     13             A.   No, sir.  The mortgage that she pays JEXEB

     14        would be paying the mortgage at Busey.

     15             Q.   Okay.  Are you familiar with a realtor by the

     16        name of Kim Grant at John Greene Realty?

     17             A.   I've never spoken to her.

     18             Q.   Okay.  Are you aware that according to

     19        Miss Grant that she discovered a lien on the property

     20        through a title search?  Are you aware of that?

     21             A.   I've seen it in court documents.

     22             Q.   And are you aware of Ms. Gordon's testimony

     23        that this is the first time that she ever knew about

     24        this lien?

     25             A.   I've seen it --


                                                                     70


      1                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  There's no

      2        testimony of Ms. Grant anywhere.

      3                  MR. KHWAJA:  But this is her testimony.

      4        That's fine if you want to object.

      5                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  So it's hearsay.

      6                  MR. KHWAJA:  Well, actually I provided a text

      7        message.  It's not exactly hearsay.  I provided a text

      8        message between Ericka and Kim Grant, the realtor.  But

      9        let me -- let me rephrase that.

     10        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     11             Q.   Are you aware that Ms. Gordon did not find out

     12        that there was a lien on this property until a title

     13        search had been conducted by Kim Grant?

     14             A.   I found that out --

     15             Q.   But are you aware --

     16             A.   -- since I discussed it.

     17             Q.   Are you aware of Ms. Gordon's testimony this

     18        was the first time she found out about the lien?

     19             A.   I'm aware of the testimony.

     20             Q.   Okay.  And are you also aware that Ms. Grant

     21        advised her that she couldn't sell the property because

     22        of the lien in place?  Are you aware of that?

     23             A.   I've seen that, and I find it ludicrous.

     24             Q.   Do you have a legal degree, sir?

     25             A.   No, sir.


                                                                     71


      1             Q.   Okay.  So this is your own personal opinion?

      2             A.   Well, I -- more than that.  I've talked to

      3        other realtors and other attorneys.

      4             Q.   Okay.  But you are aware that Ms. Gordon has

      5        testified that the first time she discovered that there

      6        was a lien on this property -- and I'll give you the

      7        date actually because we have an affidavit here.

      8                  So are you aware that at or around March 10th

      9        of 2022 Kim Grant did a property search on the property,

     10        a title search?

     11             A.   No.

     12             Q.   You're not.  Okay.

     13             A.   By testimony, there has been said, but I'm not

     14        aware of it other than what has been in court documents.

     15             Q.   But you -- but you understand that that title

     16        search led to the discovery of the Busey Bank lien, yes?

     17             A.   Shouldn't have been a first discovery, but,

     18        yeah, I've heard claim that it's a first discovery.

     19             Q.   And you do understand that Ms. Gordon has

     20        testified that was her first time under finding out

     21        about this lien, right?

     22             A.   I've seen testimony to that effect.

     23             Q.   And are you aware that based on discovery of

     24        that lien a communication was made to the Galanopoulos

     25        office regarding the lien?


                                                                     72


      1             A.   What office?

      2             Q.   Your lawyer.

      3             A.   Bob Galgan and Galanopoulos.  Okay.

      4             Q.   Yes.  Are you aware that based on discovery of

      5        the lien a communication was made to the Galgan office?

      6             A.   I don't think so.

      7             Q.   Okay.  Well, I represent to you that a

      8        communication was made to the Galgan office regarding

      9        that lien.  And are you aware that Mr. Galgan's office

     10        offered to let Ms. Gordon out of the property based on

     11        the discovery of that lien?

     12             A.   No.

     13             Q.   You're not?

     14             A.   What was offered, my conversation with Bob

     15        Galgan about that, was the same offer that had been made

     16        previously that, you know, if Ericka didn't want to pay

     17        her mortgage, we would, you know, pay her $10,000 to

     18        walk away.  That was my offer.  That wasn't Galgan's

     19        offer.

     20             Q.   I understand that.  But are you aware that

     21        Mr. Galgan actually sent a letter to Ms. Gordon giving

     22        her the option to get out of the property?

     23             A.   Yes.

     24             Q.   And that was based on after she complained

     25        about the lien against her?


                                                                     73


      1             A.   It wasn't based on that.  It was based on the

      2        fact that she had not made her payments, and she was

      3        going into foreclosure.  She didn't qualify for her

      4        refinance.  And that's what that was based on.

      5             Q.   So it's your representation --

      6             A.   It's my testimony.

      7             Q.   -- that subsequent to Mr. Galgan making notice

      8        of discovery of the lien, the reason he came back and

      9        offered to let Ms. Gordon out of the property --

     10                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  Misstates the

     11        record.

     12                  THE DEPONENT:  Misstates the record.

     13        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     14             Q.   It is your testimony that you believe that he

     15        was letting Ms. Gordon out because of missed payments

     16        and not because of the discovery of the lien?

     17             A.   Exactly.

     18             Q.   Okay.

     19             A.   I made -- I talked to Bob.  I authorized a

     20        $10,000 payment to walk away.

     21             Q.   Okay.  And you are aware that Ms. Gordon

     22        signed an affidavit with the court stating that the

     23        existing lien on the property prevented her from

     24        refinance and selling the property?

     25             A.   I've seen that document, yes.


                                                                     74


      1             Q.   But you disagree.  You think the lien is

      2        essentially meaningless?

      3             A.   Ludicrous.

      4             Q.   Okay.

      5             A.   The discussion of it is ludicrous.

      6             Q.   So I want to talk a little bit --

      7             A.   There's a page missing here.

      8             Q.   I want to talk a little bit about -- so is it

      9        fair to say that prior to the signing of the contract

     10        your agreement as far as repairs go were you would

     11        discuss it --

     12             A.   Yes.

     13             Q.   -- as things came up?

     14             A.   Yes.

     15             Q.   Okay.  And, let's see here.  So at or around

     16        August 4th of 2020, did Ericka communicate to you that

     17        she paid for an ejector pump?

     18             A.   An ejector pump repair, yes.

     19             Q.   And did she tell you that was approximately

     20        $4,945.79?

     21             A.   No.

     22             Q.   She didn't tell you the dollar amount, but she

     23        told you about it?

     24             A.   She told me 1700 bill.

     25             Q.   Okay.


                                                                     75


      1             A.   Or something like that.

      2             Q.   I'm sorry.  So the ejector pump -- I

      3        apologize.  So that's the total amount of some of these

      4        repairs, but let me get back to where I was at.

      5                  So she did advise you about the ejector pump,

      6        correct?

      7             A.   After repair, yes, sir.

      8             Q.   Okay.  And did she disclose to you how much

      9        she paid for the repair?

     10             A.   Somewhere $1700 range.

     11             Q.   Okay.  And that was to Perfect Home Services.

     12        Did she advise you of that?

     13             A.   Yes.

     14             Q.   And have you seen those receipts filed in the

     15        court?

     16             A.   Filed in the court, yes.

     17             Q.   Okay.  So did you reimburse her for those

     18        charges?

     19             A.   A portion of that, yes, sir.

     20             Q.   What amount did you reimburse her of the

     21        thirteen forty-five twenty-one?

     22             A.   I don't recall off the top of my head, but

     23        it's -- it was a portion at one point and then later on

     24        I had some, you know, paid a little bit more.  I can

     25        look it up, but I don't remember offhand.


                                                                     76


      1             Q.   Okay.  And at or around April 2021, did

      2        Ericka, again, contact you regarding the garage rollers

      3        needing repair?

      4             A.   Yes.

      5             Q.   And did she advise you that she paid

      6        approximately $348 to repair them?

      7             A.   I don't remember her telling me an amount, but

      8        she said she had them done.

      9             Q.   And did you reimburse her that amount?

     10             A.   No, sir.

     11             Q.   And what was the reason for that?

     12             A.   Because the garage was tested before she moved

     13        in and found in perfect operation.

     14             Q.   So the company that provided the repair,

     15        O'Brien Garage Door Repair Specialists --

     16             A.   Yes, sir.

     17             Q.   -- you think they charged her for a repair

     18        that didn't need to be repaired?

     19             A.   Her conversation with me caused me to call

     20        O'Brien.  When I called O'Brien, they advised me that in

     21        their records it shows that she bought an upgrade.  It

     22        does not say the rollers needed repair.  And later on

     23        when I advised Ericka of that transaction, she called me

     24        sneaky for calling O'Brien.

     25             Q.   Okay.


                                                                     77


      1             A.   I've been wondering if we should subpoena

      2        O'Brien's records and see for sure.

      3             Q.   Your lawyer can do as he chooses.

      4                  At or around November 9th, 2021, did Ericka

      5        advise you that she paid for furnace replacement, air

      6        conditioning unit from Ferguson HVAC?

      7             A.   I think we stopped talking before then.

      8             Q.   Okay.  When you say stopped talking, can you

      9        elaborate a little bit about that?

     10             A.   On advice of counsel, I was advised never to

     11        speak to Ericka again.

     12             Q.   Okay.  So the $3,252.58 to Ferguson HVAC --

     13             A.   Yes.

     14             Q.   -- that my client paid for the repair, you are

     15        aware of it?

     16             A.   By court documents.

     17             Q.   And did you reimburse this amount?

     18             A.   No.

     19             Q.   Okay.

     20             A.   I hadn't been paid mortgage payments in quite

     21        some time.

     22             Q.   Do you recall Ericka advising you about

     23        additional repairs that she made up around the dollar

     24        amount of about 1200?

     25             A.   Not offhand.


                                                                     78


      1             Q.   Okay.  You stated on the record that you don't

      2        have any emails or any type of collaborative evidence

      3        showing you communicated to Ericka there was a lien on

      4        the property, right?

      5             A.   Not that I found so far.

      6             Q.   So your testimony is that you told my client

      7        orally that there was a lien in place?

      8             A.   Yes, sir.

      9             Q.   And that she was essentially okay with it?

     10             A.   Yes.

     11             Q.   And you don't recall exactly what she said in

     12        response to you advising her about the lien?

     13             A.   No, sir.

     14                  MR. KHWAJA:  Let me see if I have any other

     15        questions.  So I want to take a five-minute break if

     16        that's okay, and then I can wrap it up.

     17                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  That's fine.

     18                  MR. KHWAJA:  Huh?

     19                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  That's fine.

     20                  MR. KHWAJA:  Yeah.  Then we'll wrap it up.

     21                  THE REPORTER:  Off the record.  2:33 p.m.

     22                  (WHEREUPON, a recess was taken.)

     23                  THE REPORTER:  Back on the record at 2:47 p.m.

     24        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     25             Q.   Mr. Bannes, you mentioned that prior to the


                                                                     79


      1        signing of the note you disclosed to Ms. Gordon that

      2        there was a lien against the property, correct?

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   When did you tell Ms. Gordon you had resolved

      5        the lien?

      6             A.   Didn't disclose, didn't discuss.

      7             Q.   So the lien would remain on her property

      8        until --

      9             A.   If I hadn't sold the property, the loan

     10        probably would have stayed on for some time.

     11             Q.   But at that point, she was the purchaser.  She

     12        was occupying the property.  So what did you convey to

     13        her regarding this encumbrance against the house?  How

     14        were you going to resolve it?

     15             A.   At the time that she refinanced in 13 months,

     16        it would have been paid off.

     17             Q.   So you told her --

     18             A.   I didn't tell her.  You asked me what my

     19        understanding was.

     20             Q.   Well, I want to know what you told my client.

     21             A.   I don't know.  I don't know.  I have no idea

     22        what I -- I don't recall telling her anything.

     23             Q.   Okay.  So can you tell me exactly what you

     24        said regarding --

     25             A.   No.


                                                                     80


      1             Q.   -- your disclosure of the lien?  Okay.

      2             A.   Sorry.

      3             Q.   You can't -- it's your testimony that you

      4        disclosed the lien?

      5             A.   Yes.

      6             Q.   But you did not come to an arrangement or

      7        advise my client how and when it would be resolved,

      8        correct?

      9             A.   No.

     10             Q.   Okay.  And did you think that was fair to the

     11        client?

     12             A.   Yes.

     13             Q.   So does this real estate contract you've

     14        provided say anything about a lien against the property?

     15             A.   No, sir.

     16             Q.   Okay.  Is there a reason why?

     17             A.   Why would it?  There's no space on there for

     18        it.  It's not usually on a real estate contract.

     19             Q.   Would you agree that the sale price was

     20        283,000 for this house?

     21             A.   That sounds about right.

     22             Q.   Okay.  So sorry, 273,000?

     23             A.   Okay.

     24             Q.   And what was the amount of the mortgage with

     25        Busey Bank?


                                                                     81


      1                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  At what time?

      2                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah, at --

      3                  MR. KHWAJA:  At the time that he borrowed the

      4        money and took the mortgage.

      5                  THE WITNESS:  Not after the loan.

      6        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      7             Q.   Not after payments.  At the time that you

      8        took --

      9             A.   I'd have to look.  I have no idea.

     10             Q.   Do you have an estimate?

     11             A.   250, 260.

     12             Q.   Okay.  Earlier you showed a mortgage

     13        calculator, didn't you, with respect to how much Ericka

     14        would pay and what the payments would be?

     15             A.   Yes.

     16             Q.   And wasn't it your testimony that those

     17        payments were in consideration of the existing lien on

     18        the property?

     19             A.   Yes.

     20             Q.   So how is it that those payments would have

     21        sufficiently covered both this note and the Busey Bank

     22        lien?

     23             A.   It did.

     24             Q.   It did.  Can you give me a summary of the math

     25        how?


                                                                     82


      1             A.   A summary of the math out.  What do you mean

      2        by that.

      3             Q.   Sure.  The note says the payments are

      4        2,594.75.  What were the amounts of the payments for the

      5        Busey Bank lien when you took it?

      6             A.   Payment on the Busey Bank lien was about

      7        1,081, something like that.

      8             Q.   1,081?

      9             A.   Yes.

     10             Q.   And there weren't any other mortgages on the

     11        property, right?

     12             A.   No, sir.

     13             Q.   So you believe that this price of 2594.75 for

     14        24 months was sufficient to cover this mortgage and to

     15        cover your existing debt with Busey Bank?

     16             A.   Yes, sir.  I did for five or six months.

     17             Q.   And, again, there's no written or formal

     18        communications of disclosure of this lien to Ms. Gordon,

     19        right?

     20                  MR. KHWAJA:  Objection.  Misstates the record.

     21        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     22             Q.   Is there any formal disclosures via written or

     23        text message --

     24             A.   Nothing found so far.

     25             Q.   Written, text message, or letter?


                                                                     83


      1             A.   Nothing found so far.

      2             Q.   Nothing found so far.  Okay.  Do you think it

      3        would be unusual to not disclose something like that --

      4             A.   No, sir.

      5             Q.   -- in writing, to notify --

      6             A.   No, sir.

      7             Q.   -- a potential buyer?

      8             A.   No, sir.

      9             Q.   You didn't think it was important to notify a

     10        buyer regarding a significant defect in a property?

     11             A.   Not a defect.

     12             Q.   It absolutely is.  Okay.

     13             A.   Your characterization, not mine.

     14             Q.   And the real estate contract that you've

     15        provided today, did you eventually produce this to

     16        Lauren -- attorney Lauren Jackson?

     17             A.   I have never produced it for Lauren, no.

     18             Q.   Can you tell me the individuals you did

     19        produce it for?

     20             A.   I -- here today.  I don't know anybody else I

     21        might have asked, given it to.  I don't know.

     22             Q.   So is it your testimony this is the first time

     23        the real estate contract has been produced to Ms. Gordon

     24        by and through her attorney?

     25             A.   I -- no.


                                                                     84


      1             Q.   So when --

      2             A.   I can't testify when she saw it because she

      3        should have signed it when she saw it -- she signed it

      4        on DocuSign.

      5             Q.   Okay.

      6             A.   So I can't imagine this is the first time

      7        she's seen it if she signed it on DocuSign.

      8             Q.   Okay.  So you don't know --

      9             A.   I do not know.

     10             Q.   -- if Ms. Francine Blackmond presented her

     11        this document?

     12             A.   I have no idea.

     13             Q.   So it's your testimony that you don't have any

     14        actual knowledge when she first saw this?

     15             A.   Absolutely.

     16             Q.   Okay.  Let me see if I have any other --

     17                  Do you have any email communications, text

     18        message, or letters regarding you advising Ms. Gordon to

     19        not hire a lawyer or that you would hire your own

     20        lawyer?

     21             A.   No.

     22             Q.   But you did tell her your lawyer would handle

     23        the paperwork?

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   Okay.  And you don't have any knowledge


                                                                     85


      1        whether your attorney actually official -- explained any

      2        of these documents to her?

      3                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

      4                  MR. KHWAJA:  I don't have any further

      5        questions.

      6                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Okay.  I have a few.

      7                  MR. KHWAJA:  You sitting here, Counsel?

      8                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  I'll just -- right at the end.

      9        That's fine.

     10                  MR. KHWAJA:  What's that?

     11                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  I'll just sit here.

     12                  MR. KHWAJA:  Okay.  All right.

     13                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  What number are we on for

     14        exhibits?

     15                  MR. KHWAJA:  I think I have 5.

     16                  THE REPORTER:  Yes, 5.  So 6.

     17                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  All right.  Let's mark that as

     18        6.

     19                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 6 was marked for

     20        identification.)

     21                  MR. KHWAJA:  This is one you just --

     22                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Yeah, this is one of the ones I

     23        just handed you.  It's closing statement.

                                                                     86

      5             Q.   And that's for the transaction for 156 River

      6        Mist Drive --

      8             Q.   -- that we're talking about.  And is that your

      9        signature on there?

     10             A.   Yes, sir.

     11             Q.   Do you recognize Ms. Gordon's signature on

     12        there?

     13             A.   Yes, sir.

     14             Q.   Okay.  Do you remember when this document was

     15        signed?

     16             A.   At closing.

     17             Q.   Which was what date?

     18             A.   That would be in July.  It's not on there.

     19        July 6th I think is when we closed.

     21             A.   Two days after the 4th of July.

     22             Q.   Okay.  All right.  And Ms. Gordon was given

     23        this when she signed it?

     24             A.   Yes.

     25             Q.   Is that correct?  Okay.  And does this

      1        indicate on the closing statement that there's a charge

      2        for title charges --

      3             A.   Yes.

      4             Q.   -- to the seller?

      5             A.   Yep.

      6             Q.   What's your understanding of what that $1940

      7        pays for?

      8             A.   Title charges pays for transfers and transfer

      9        taxes and recording of deeds and, you know, could be

     10        title policies and all that other stuff that's part of

     11        what the lawyers charge you.

     12             Q.   Okay.

     13             A.   To be deal done.

     14             Q.   We had a separate line item on here for

     15        transfer taxes.

     16             A.   Yeah.

     17             Q.   So that wouldn't be a part of that recording.

     18             A.   Wouldn't be a part of that one.

     19             Q.   Right?

     20             A.   So that would be, yeah.

     21             Q.   And then we've got some other association --

     22             A.   Yeah, association fees.

     23             Q.   -- things.

     24             A.   Yep.  Yep.  Yeah.

     25             Q.   Okay.  All right.  So would it be fair to say


                                                                     88


      1        that the title charges include the charge for a title

      2        policy?

      3             A.   Probably.  I mean if -- yeah.

      4             Q.   Okay.  All right.  There was some discussion

      5        earlier --

      6                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  This is Exhibit 7.

      7                  (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 7 was marked for

      8        identification.)

      9        BY MR. CLAAHSEN:

     10             Q.   -- regarding preclosing repairs that were

     11        made?

     12             A.   Yes, this is a summary.

     13             Q.   I'll show you Exhibit 7.  What is that?

     14             A.   That's a summary I made of what the

     15        corporation owed me back personally for repairs that

     16        were done to the property preclosing.

     17             Q.   Okay.  So at the top, what does it say?

     18             A.   JEXEB owes John.

     19             Q.   Meaning you?

     20             A.   Yes.

     21             Q.   Okay.  And so these were items you wanted the

     22        corporation to reimburse you?

     23             A.   Corporation had to reimburse John because he

     24        bought all of these things on his personal card --

     25        charge card since the corporation doesn't have one.


                                                                     89


      1             Q.   Okay.  And it's your testimony that all of

      2        these items were for repairs made to --

      3             A.   To the property.

      4             Q.   -- River Mist --

      5             A.   Yes.

      6             Q.   -- prior to July 6?

      7             A.   Yes.

      8             Q.   I ask you here, the fourth one down, it says

      9        Menards, and it has the word Joliet above it.

     10             A.   Which Menards I went to because sometimes I

     11        would go to Menards in Crest Hill.

     12             Q.   Okay.

     13             A.   So Menards, you know, bought softener salt for

     14        the softener.

     15             Q.   That didn't refer to softener salt for your

     16        Joliet house?

     17             A.   No.

     18             Q.   Okay.

     19             A.   No, the receipt, you know, Menards receipts,

     20        if you find -- if I produce those, you'll see where I

     21        have stuff that's written going to Joliet, going to

     22        River Mist.  It's all broken down.  These are the River

     23        Mist expenses.

     24             Q.   Okay.  Let's just go through them.  What's the

     25        first one?


                                                                     90


      1             A.   That's the AC repair.  It was charged on my

      2        Universal card.

      3             Q.   And that's in the amount of?

      4             A.   $300.

      5             Q.   What's the second one?

      6             A.   S and J Carpet Care.  The carpets were cleaned

      7        in the property, $360.50.

      8             Q.   The third one?

      9             A.   The O'Brien garage door inspection.  They

     10        produced that it was fine.

     11             Q.   Fourth item?

     12             A.   That's the softener salt for the softener at

     13        the property.

     14             Q.   What's the fifth item?

     15             A.   Great Escape, I bought some chemicals for the

     16        hot tub that's in the master bedroom to make sure it got

     17        cleaned out, spa purge.

     18             Q.   Okay.  And the next item?

     19             A.   Menards, we needed some toilet seats, some

     20        plumbing putty, some -- the range anti-tip device, all

     21        those things that were identified by the inspector that

     22        needed repair.  I think we replaced a number of toilet

     23        seals as I recall.

     24             Q.   Okay.  And there's a --

     25             A.   9-volt batteries for all the detectors.  All


                                                                     91


      1        the detectors, you know, alarm detectors -- smoke

      2        detectors were changed.  Drain cleaner, make sure the

      3        drains were running.  There was an outlet cover missing

      4        that had to be purchased and put on.  Connector of some

      5        kind that had to be done.  The front door, bottom door

      6        seal wasn't good.  So that got changed.  This barbell

      7        was part of, I think, the softener, if I recall right.

      8        I bought a tool to be able to change the recessed lights

      9        which were 20 feet above your head over the fireplace.

     10        Postage, I think I sent some thing something.  Deck

     11        staining, River Mist requires the deck stain about every

     12        two or three years.

     13                  And then the tenant, Chris' stock --

     14        Chris was -- from his stock I used his LED

     15        bulbs to change the bulbs that were used.  I didn't have

     16        to buy bulbs.

     17             Q.   Okay.  And this is a pretty detailed list.  Is

     18        it your testimony that this came from a written

     19        inspection report that Ms. Gordon had --

     20             A.   Yes.

     21             Q.   -- done to the property?

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   Okay.

     24             A.   White glove inspection, inspected property pre

     25        her purchase.


                                                                     92


      1             Q.   And did you negotiate these with Ericka or

      2        with the inspector?

      3             A.   No, with Ericka.

      4             Q.   Okay.  All right.  And --

      5             A.   I never spoke to the inspector.

      6             Q.   -- there's a total at the bottom there --

      7             A.   Twelve oh two ninety-four.

      8             Q.   -- did you total the bill?

      9             A.   Yes.  JEXEB pay John.

     10             Q.   Okay.

     11                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Is this Exhibit 1?

     12                  MR. KHWAJA:  Yes, it was.

     13        BY MR. CLAAHSEN:

     14             Q.   Okay.  Do you recall being asked about this --

     15             A.   Yes.

     16             Q.   -- Exhibit 1 today?

     17             A.   Yes.

     18             Q.   Was this a sale from you to JEXEB?

     19             A.   No, I gave the property there.  It shows a $10

     20        fee.  There was no transfer taxes.  I mean, personally

     21        conveyed the property to the corporation.

     22             Q.   Okay.  And it's a quitclaim deed?

     23             A.   Yes.

     24             Q.   And does that indicate to you that there was

     25        no money changing hands?


                                                                     93


      1             A.   JEXEB didn't give John any money.

      2             Q.   All right.  And then this was marked as

      3        Exhibit 6 in Ms. Gordon's deposition last week.

      4                  MR. KHWAJA:  You've got some extras, or you

      5        can pass it around if you don't.

      6                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  I'll pass it around.  I'm sure

      7        we all looked at it last week.

      8                  MR. KHWAJA:  I don't have it on me.

      9                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Okay.

     10        BY MR. CLAAHSEN:

     11             Q.   At the back here there's a schedule of

     12        exceptions.

     13                  MR. KHWAJA:  By the way, I'm going to just

     14        object to this because Mr. Bannes has testified he

     15        didn't testify to a title policy being there.  He didn't

     16        remember.  So just to state my objection.

     17                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Okay.

     18        BY MR. CLAAHSEN:

     19             Q.   You remember being asked by counsel if there

     20        was any written documentation that disclosed the lien to

     21        Ms. Gordon.  Do you recall that --

     22             A.   Yes.

     23             Q.   -- question?  Do you recall your answer?

     24             A.   As I recall, I can't say what written there

     25        was that I had done.  Yeah.


                                                                     94


      1             Q.   Okay.  So was that your understanding is that

      2        it was written documentation that you had personally

      3        prepared?

      4             A.   No.  There is nothing I personally prepared.

      5        I think that -- that the disclosed, the, you know, the

      6        other mortgage, the corporation's mortgage.

      7             Q.   So in answering the question, you were not

      8        thinking of this title commitment --

      9             A.   No.

     10             Q.   -- one way or the other?

     11             A.   No.  Because nothing got -- I didn't

     12        personally prepare that so.

     13             Q.   So you believe the question to be as to what

     14        you personally prepared?

     15             A.   Personally prepared.

     16             Q.   Okay.

     17             A.   Yes.  Yes.

     18             Q.   Do you believe that this title commitment was

     19        given to Ms. Gordon at the closing or before?

     20             A.   I don't know for certain.  I -- I know it's

     21        been around a number of times.  I don't know where I saw

     22        it first and when I saw it last.  And, yeah, it's been

     23        around.  It should have been around there at that time.

     24             Q.   Okay.

     25             A.   But I --


                                                                     95


      1             Q.   It's fair to say that this title commitment

      2        references the Busey Bank loan?

      3             A.   It references the lien, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That

      4        -- while it's been around, the lien is noted.

      5                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Okay.  That's all the

      6        questions.

      7                  THE DEPONENT:  And it's in excess.

      8                  MR. KHWAJA:  I've got a couple questions.

      9                  Back on the record, Daniel Khwaja.

     10        FURTHER EXAMINATION

     11        BY MR. KHWAJA:

     12             Q.   Mr. Bannes, you've testified that you were at

     13        the closing, Ericka was there, and her mother, and a

     14        fourth person?

     15             A.   Someone from the real -- lawyer's office, yes.

     16             Q.   But you don't remember who that person was?

     17             A.   No, and I think there was a fifth person.  I

     18        think like there was more people at the table than that,

     19        but.

     20             Q.   So is it fair to say that because you can't

     21        remember the people that were at the closing, your

     22        memory is not very good of the date in question?

     23             A.   Depends on the specific question you're going

     24        to ask.  I have very good answers about some things, but

     25        some things I can't answer.


                                                                     96


      1             Q.   Okay.  But it is your testimony you can't

      2        remember if there was four or five people there, right?

      3             A.   That would be true.

      4             Q.   Okay.  And I asked you what documents were

      5        presented at the closing, and I believe you said the

      6        mortgage, the note, and then --

      7             A.   Deed.

      8             Q.   -- the deed.  And then after that, you weren't

      9        very sure, right?

     10             A.   I think they're at four, but, yeah, something

     11        like that, yes.

     12             Q.   Those are the documents that you recall?

     13             A.   Yeah.

     14             Q.   You don't particularly recall this seller's

     15        closing statement being produced, correct?

     16             A.   Yes.

     17             Q.   You do?

     18             A.   Yes.

     19             Q.   Because that's not what you testified earlier?

     20             A.   Okay.  I forgot it earlier.  Yeah, what I

     21        could remember at that moment.

     22             Q.   Okay.

     23             A.   Yeah.

     24             Q.   So you recall the seller closing statement --

     25             A.   Yes.


                                                                     97


      1             Q.   -- being produced?

      2             A.   Yes.

      3             Q.   Yet there's no date on this document --

      4             A.   Yes.

      5             Q.   -- right?

      6             A.   Yep.

      7             Q.   So we have no idea if this document was

      8        produced --

      9             A.   Right.

     10             Q.   -- or ever dated?

     11             A.   Right.  Right.  I can see when I scanned it.

     12             Q.   The person that you spoke with most at the

     13        Galgan and Galanopoulos firm as far as the attorneys go

     14        was who?

     15             A.   Bob Galgan.

     16             Q.   Did you speak to him only?

     17             A.   A staff member once in awhile interrupts, you

     18        know, takes a call or something, but I only discuss

     19        things with Bob.

     20             Q.   Did you ever discuss with him the lien on this

     21        property?

     22                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Objection.  Not a real

     23        objection.  Which lien are we talking about?

     24                  MR. KHWAJA:  Busey Bank lien.

     25                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  Okay.


                                                                     98


      1        BY MR. KHWAJA:

      2             Q.   Did you ever discuss the Busey Bank lien with

      3        him?

      4             A.   I have no recollection for or not.

      5             Q.   Okay.  And did you ever discuss whether the

      6        close -- any of the closing documents including the

      7        title policy would contain reference to the Busey Bank

      8        lien in it?

      9             A.   I don't know what I discussed with him in

     10        regard to that.  I, you know --

     11             Q.   So you don't remember?

     12             A.   Yeah.

     13             Q.   And you don't remember if there was actual

     14        title documents presented at the closing, do you?

     15             A.   Title documents?

     16             Q.   Like this one, for instance.

     17             A.   I do not recall if, you know -- no, I don't

     18        recall that specifically.

     19             Q.   You don't recall this document specifically.

     20                  MR. KHWAJA:  Okay.  I don't have any other

     21        questions.

     22                  MR. CLAAHSEN:  No further questions.
