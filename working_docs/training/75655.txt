ðŸš©\n 
          7             VIDEOGRAPHER:  Stand by.  We are on the record.

          8   The time is 1:45 p.m.  The date is June 14th, 2024.  This is

          9   the beginning of the deposition of Mark Balbuena.  The case

         10   caption is Stephens vs. Holland American Lines.  Will

         11   counsel introduce yourselves and state whom you represent.

         12             MR. WHITEHEAD:  I'm Jim Whitehead.  I represent

         13   the plaintiff, Susan Stephens.

         14             MR. POLITIS:  I'm Nick Politis for Holland

         15   American Line.

         16             VIDEOGRAPHER:  The court reporter will now swear

         17   in the witness.

         18             THE REPORTER:  Thank you.  Mr. Balbuena, please

         19   raise your right hand.  Do you affirm, under penalty of

         20   perjury, that the testimony you are about to give will be

         21   the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?  And

         22   I apologize, you'll have to use verbal responses such as

         23   "yes" or "no".  I can't capture like a head nod.

         24             THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         25             THE REPORTER:  Thank you.  All right.  Counsel,





                                                                     4

          1   please proceed.

          2             MR. POLITIS:  Thank you.  Mr. Balbuena, before we

          3   get started, I just wanted to mention a couple of things.

          4   First, I'd like an opportunity for the witness to

          5   read/review of the deposition transcript.  I'd just like to

          6   get it on the record right now.

          7             And I would also indicate English is his second

          8   language, counsel.  So if you would, echoing the reporter's

          9   instructions, move sort of slowly with him so that he can

         10   understand your questions.  Thank you.

         11             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Are we ready to proceed?

         12             MR. POLITIS:  Yes.

         13

         14   MARK BALBUENA, having been first duly affirmed to tell the

         15   truth, was examined, and testified as follows:

         16

         17   EXAMINATION

         18   BY MR. WHITEHEAD:

         19        Q.   Mr. Balbuena, have you ever given a deposition

         20   before?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   Okay.  When you say that, I then have a list of

         23   things to say to you that are important to make this as

         24   successful as possible.  Fortunately, the court reporter has

         25   already taken some of my thunder, but that's good because





                                                                     5

          1   that means that I don't have to repeat everything.  But you

          2   need to tell the truth to the best of your ability, you

          3   know, your -- the best of your knowledge or belief.  We want

          4   to get a good, clean record.  If you don't understand any

          5   question that I ask you, please let me know, and I will try

          6   to rephrase it so that it's more understandable.

          7             The court reporter told you about it's important

          8   that we not talk at the same time.  She's talking to me as

          9   well as to you.  Most people, I think, and certainly a lot

         10   of lawyers, will hesitate in the middle of a sentence.  And

         11   you need to let me finish the question before you start

         12   answering.  Because if you answer before I'm finished, we're

         13   likely to be talking at the same time, and the court

         14   reporter is going to have a hard time.

         15             And again, it's important that you use words,

         16   "yes", "no", but not rely on us to understand, you know, a

         17   shake of the head or a nod of the head.  We want words.

         18             If at any time you would like to take a break, let

         19   me know.  The only exception to taking a break right away is

         20   if I have asked you a question that you have not yet

         21   answered.  I will then ask you to answer the question, and

         22   then if you need a break, we can take a break at that point.

         23   And unless it's an emergency, those breaks will probably

         24   just be five minutes, maybe 10 minutes long.

         25             What was that?





                                                                     6

          1             MR. POLITIS:  Sorry.

          2        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  Okay.  So do you have any

          3   questions about those guidelines?  Mr. Balbuena, can you

          4   hear me?

          5        A.   No, it's okay.

          6        Q.   Okay.  So how old are you, sir?

          7        A.   I just turned 50 last March.

         10        Q.   Okay.  And are you currently employed?

         11        A.   Currently employed with Holland American Line on

         12   board, MS Eurodam now.

         13        Q.   Which vessel?

         14        A.   Eurodam, MS Eurodam.

         15        Q.   Okay.  When did you start working for Holland

         16   America?

         17        A.   In way back 2003.

         18        Q.   And have you worked for them steadily since 2003?

         19        A.   Pardon me?  Come again.

         20        Q.   Have you worked for Holland America since 2003,

         21   all the way to the present time?

         22        A.   Yes, sir.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Can you describe briefly any other jobs

         24   you've had before starting to work for Holland America?

         25        A.   I worked with a small, like a bus craft in the





                                                                     7

          1   Philippines.  That's where I learned to (inaudible).  And I

          2   have a stint as well in hotels.  Yeah, that hotel is

          3   addition resort hotel.  My starting point to greeting and

          4   working with cruise ships, like Holland American Line.

          5        Q.   Okay.  What did you do for those other companies?

          6   What were the responsibilities you had?

          7        A.   Oh, I worked -- I've been doing the bartender --

          8   bartending, yes.  In Plantation Bay, I was, like, in the

          9   guest services as well.  And same time, I worked as

         10   bartender.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And your current job with Holland America

         12   is as a bartender?

         13        A.   It's a head bartender.

         14        Q.   Okay.  I don't really know whether this question

         15   will make sense or not, but is there -- the title of

         16   bartender, does that always mean the same thing to people in

         17   the business?  In other words, you say you're a bartender,

         18   and a knowledgeable person would know exactly what you did

         19   in your job?

         20        A.   I read you what this says, so -- I'm doing bartendering, and it's

         21   in hospitality, and I'm preparing drinks and being mixology

         22   in that sense, and serve drinks to the guests.

         23        Q.   Okay.  So did you work on the Nieuw Statendam

         24   cruise ship in February of 2023 on its Caribbean cruise?

                                                                     8

          1        Q.   Okay.  And was your job title then bartender?

          2        A.   I was a bartender.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall an accident occurring on

          4   February 25th, 2023, involving Susan Stephens, my client?

          5        A.   Yes, sir.

          6        Q.   What were your responsibilities on that day?

          7        A.   Pardon me, again?

          8        Q.   Do you remember what specifically your

          9   responsibilities were as a bartender on that day, or what

         10   you did that day?

         11        A.   Oh, all right.  I was getting all this mise en

         12   place in the bar.  Yes, I need to prepare all the equipment.

         13   I need to have the ice ready.  I need to -- all the

         14   preparation that the bar would be ready for a sailaway.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Did you have a supervisor on the vessel

         16   that day?

         17        A.   Well, my -- on that particular line, yes, I am the

         18   supervisor.  But the supervisor, he is on call.  He's on

         19   call.  He's got to be on the other side of the bar, then

         20   he'll be running to the other bar.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Well, I'm not sure I'm understanding.  Were

         22   you the head bartender that day?

         23        A.   No, I am a bartender.  I wasn't head bartender

         24   yet.

         25        Q.   Okay.  So I think I already asked you about the





                                                                     9

          1   accident.  Do you remember where the accident occurred, for

          2   Ms. Stephens?

          3        A.   Yes, it was in front of the Sea View Bar.

          4        Q.   In front of the what bar?

          5        A.   Sea View.

          6        Q.   Sea View.  Sea View Bar.  Okay.

          7        A.   The outside the deck, aft, the back of the ship.

          8        Q.   Can you describe your recollection of the

          9   accident?

         10        A.   Yes, I can describe, sir.  You want me to say it?

         11        Q.   Please do.

         12        A.   Yeah, that was a day where we were busy preparing

         13   my bar, because we were expecting for a sailaway party.  So

         14   it's a normal day for me to have my bar ready, all the mise

         15   en place from all these drinks, preparing all these

         16   garnishes, ice, supposedly.  And that's it.  That's my

         17   primary job on that day.

         18        Q.   Okay.  And can you describe how the accident

         19   happened?

         20        A.   It start out -- it happened when we were -- got

         21   busy, and I was bartendering inside the bar.  Then when I

         22   check my ice bin, that I didn't have any ice anymore.  So I

         23   decided to come out from the bar and get some ice for the

         24   other side of the pantry.  So I need to get that ice cubes

         25   to the other side, to the pantry.





                                                                    10

          1        Q.   You were going to take them to the pantry?

          2        A.   Yes.  I need to get the ice to the pantry where

          3   the ice bucket was located.

          4        Q.   Oh, that's where you had to go to get the ice?

          5        A.   Yes.  Yes, sir.

          6        Q.   Okay.  And so how -- what were you using to carry

          7   the ice?  Or what was your plan when you got the ice?  How

          8   were you going to get it back to where it was needed?

          9        A.   Well, we are using this cart to transport the ice

         10   from the other side and to get through the bar to the other

         11   side.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Was there more than one bar on that deck?

         13        A.   No, there's only one bar, sir, Sea View Bar, and

         14   it has the pantry.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So you're pushing the cart, and then what

         16   happened?

         17        A.   Yes.  When I took the ice to the other side a--

         18   and of course, I need to transport that ice using the cart.

         19   And since it was a busy day, so I need to stop from time to

         20   time, stop.  And then suddenly, there was a lady just right

         21   -- crossing my way, and that's when the accident happened.

         22        Q.   You hit her; is that correct?

         23             MR. POLITIS:  Objection leading.

         24        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  When you say that's what

         25   happened, can you just an little bit more specific?  You





                                                                    11

          1   said that that lady was near by, and that's when --

          2        A.   She just came out from nowhere, from the right

          3   side of my cart.  And as far as I remember, she was just --

          4   she was seeing her husband to the other side in the smoking

          5   area, and she was not minding that I was there.  And that's

          6   where she fell down.

          7        Q.   Did she tell you, or did someone tell you that she

          8   was looking at her husband?

          9        A.   No, no.  I was the one who was writing.  And I

         10   could see that there was a guy on the other side and

         11   looking.  And I don't know who he is looking.  And just,

         12   that lady just came by on the right side of my cart, and she

         13   fell down.

         14        Q.   So did you decide later that the guy that you had

         15   seen was her husband?

         16        A.   Well, later -- no, later I learned that that guy

         17   was her husband.

         18        Q.   Okay.  So I'm not trying to trick you, I'm trying

         19   to understand everything and what we covered and what we

         20   didn't.  So you said that she came out of nowhere, and you

         21   think she was looking for her husband.  Did the cart come

         22   into contact with her?

         23        A.   No, because there was clear way, as I moving

         24   forward, and she just -- my right side, and then she just

         25   came and she fell down, just like that.  It's just like a





                                                                    12

          1   surprise, you know, that she came on that side of the way.

          2        Q.   Well, when I say was there a contact between the

          3   cart and Ms. Stephens, what I mean is did they run into each

          4   other?

          5        A.   No.  No, sir.

          6        Q.   So is it your position that she just fell down by

          7   herself without any involvement by you?

          8        A.   She went to cross the way.

          9        Q.   Right.

         10        A.   While I'm heading forward to my cart, and suddenly

         11   she came up on the right side, and she hit my cart.

         12        Q.   Oh, she hit your cart?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And then what happened?

         15        A.   Oh, she fell down, of course.  And it was stopped

         16   when the incident happened.  And I asked her if she's okay,

         17   and I asked her if she needed some -- any medical help.  And

         18   I helped her to get her up, because she is now -- tried to

         19   -- just help her, as much as I want to help her.  And I

         20   tried to escort her towards the other side where what was

         21   supposed to be -- her husband was waiting for her.

         22        Q.   Okay.  When did you first see Ms. Stephens just

         23   before the accident?  You said that she was --

         24        A.   I just was seeing her first time when she pop up.

         25        Q.   I'm asking when you saw her for the first time,





                                                                    13

          1   where she was.

          2        A.   For the first time?  That was the accident

          3   happened.  That was the first time I saw her.

          4        Q.   Okay.  Was there any reason why you couldn't have

          5   seen her sooner?  Was something in the way?

          6        A.   No, sir.

          7        Q.   You don't recall any passenger or worker standing

          8   right next to where she was passing?

          9        A.   There were guests right next to -- just right next

         10   to my cart, there was a guest, like, standing there.  And

         11   she was just, like, there next to that lady.  And she was

         12   just, like, right across.  And she hit my cart.

         13        Q.   When you said "that lady", were you referring to

         14   Ms. Stephens or the person that was standing --

         15        A.   The person standing there.  That person standing

         16   there.

         17        Q.   Okay.  How would you describe that person?  Do you

         18   remember what she looked like?

         19        A.   I have no idea what she looks like.

         20        Q.   Okay.  So you made the decision to get the the ice

         21   and to move the ice -- you made that decision on your own?

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   Nobody told you to do that.  Right?

         24        A.   Nobody told me.

         25        Q.   Okay.  I'm still not clear on whether the cart was





                                                                    14

          1   carrying the ice at the time, or you were going to get the

          2   ice.  Can you tell me which?

          3        A.   I am carrying the ice.  I am now carrying that ice

          4   by my cart.  My cart with ice inside.

          5        Q.   Okay.  And that was just before the accident?

          6        A.   Yes.

          7        Q.   Okay.  And do you know how much that cart weighed

          8   at that time, or probably weighed at that time?

          9        A.   Well, ice is around -- by kilos for me, 50 to 100

         10   kilos.

         11        Q.   50 to 100 kilos.  How large was the cart?  How

         12   long was it?  How high was it?  And then how wide was it?

         13   Can you estimate?

         14        A.   I think about my waist, waist or tummy, and long

         15   enough to reach, like, let's say one meter forward from

         16   where I hold the handle of that cart.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So is it -- at the top, is it more or less

         18   a square, sort of --

         19        A.   Yes, a square.

         20        Q.   -- equally long and equally wide?  I mean, in

         21   other words, if you stopped your cart and you went to the

         22   left side and then you reached across it with your arm,

         23   would that be about a meter?

         24             MR. POLITIS:  Objection, vague.

         25        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  You can answer if you think





                                                                    15

          1   you know that I was asking.  I'll rephrase the question.  Do

          2   you want me to rephrase it?

          3        A.   Yes, please.  Can you rephrase it?

          4        Q.   Well, when you said that you could reach out with

          5   your arm and it was about a meter, were you talking about

          6   the distance from the side that you were -- from the handle

          7   that you were pushing until the far side -- I mean, until

          8   the end of that side?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   Okay.  And --

         11        A.   Excuse me, sir.  I need to say something.  Can I

         12   make it more elaborate?

         13        Q.   Sure.

         14        A.   All right.  So if I am holding the handle from my

         15   tummy, that would be around almost a meter, almost a meter

         16   forward.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And what if you stepped around it, let's

         18   say to the right, and then you turned to look at the cart,

         19   and you reached across the width of the cart.  Would that

         20   also be about a meter?

         21        A.   From the right towards -- no, this is around --

         22   I'd say one foot and a half, maybe.  Or it's one foot.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Did you find that it was difficult to push?

         24        A.   No, no, no.  The cart has big wheels at the back

         25   and it has small wheels in front.





                                                                    16

          1        Q.   Okay.  Just before the accident, do you recall

          2   talking to anybody that you saw as you were pushing the

          3   cart?

          4        A.   No, I wasn't talking to anybody.  I was just, like

          5   -- like, for me, it's just, like, to get through this cart,

          6   as much as I want to go to the other side and refill my ice,

          7   and refill the ice into my bar.

          8        Q.   Okay.  If you remember how you were pushing the

          9   cart just before the accident, off to your left, was there a

         10   bar there?

         11        A.   Yes, it has -- there were people, yeah.

         12        Q.   Do you remember talking, as you're pushing the

         13   cart?  Do you remember looking over at the bar and maybe

         14   saying something to somebody there that you knew?

         15        A.   No.  I didn't talk to anybody there.

         16        Q.   Was the area very crowded at that time?

         17        A.   Pardon me?

         18        Q.   Was the deck very crowded, lots of people?

         19        A.   Yes, lots of people.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Do you believe the accident was your fault

         21   at all?

         22        A.   No.

         23        Q.   Do you recall when you were -- well, the first

         24   time you saw Ms. Stephens, was that after she passed by the

         25   woman that you described earlier that was standing there?





                                                                    17

          1   In other words, you didn't see her before she got up next to

          2   that woman.  Is that right?

          3        A.   I didn't see her.  I didn't see her.

          4        Q.   Okay.  And so then did she actually pass that

          5   woman before the accident?

          6        A.   Before the accident?

          7        Q.   Right.

          8        A.   I could not recall if she passed that woman.  But

          9   as long as she just popped up from that right side, she

         10   bumped the cart, and that's what happened.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Were you able to stop the cart before you

         12   hit her?

         13        A.   Yeah, I --

         14             MR. POLITIS:  Objection, vague, states facts not

         15   in evidence.

         16        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  I'm sorry, your answer was

         17   what?  I asked you if you had stopped the cart before you

         18   hit her -- or before she hit you.  Yeah, I don't care -- in

         19   other words -- and I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I want to

         20   be sure this is clear.  You saw her, the way she was

         21   walking.  Did you stop the cart before there was contact

         22   between the cart and Ms. Stephens?

         23             MR. POLITIS:  Objection, vague.  You can answer.

         24             THE WITNESS:  I can answer?

         25             MR. POLITIS:  If you understand, yeah.





                                                                    18

          1        A.   No.  You were saying that before I -- before she

          2   hit the cart.  No, I didn't see her.

          3        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  Did not see her?

          4        A.   I didn't see her.

          5        Q.   Okay.  So you mentioned that she fell to the deck,

          6   and then you tried to help her up.  Is that right?

          7        A.   Right.

          8        Q.   And I wasn't clear on -- you may not have said

          9   anything about this, but were you able to get her to her

         10   feet, and then, you know -- or did you get her off the deck?

         11        A.   She actually want some help.  She tried to just --

         12   rising, or tried to get up using her hand.  And I grabbed

         13   her hand and I asked her if she needed some medical help.

         14   But she is maybe actually losing her balance, and she wanted

         15   that -- she grabbed on my hand and moving forward.

         16        Q.   Did you actually get her off the deck?  Did she

         17   stand up?

         18        A.   No, she tried to -- I tried to help her once, to

         19   held my hand, but she actually asking for, you know -- her

         20   hand, and grabbed my hand, and she got up.

         21        Q.   I'm sorry.  I'm just not following this

         22   completely.  So she did stand up while you were standing

         23   there?

         24        A.   Yes, because she need to grab my hand, and I asked

         25   her if she need some medical help, if she needed something.





                                                                    19

          1   And then when I grabbed her hand, she actually wants to see

          2   her husband for the other side.  It was supposed to be the

          3   man in the smoking side.

          4        Q.   Did you see her go to her husband?

          5        A.   I help her to stand up, and escorted her to her

          6   husband, to the other side.  Yes, sir.

          7        Q.   Okay.  Did her husband start coming towards you

          8   before you got to the place that he was at the time of the

          9   accident?

         10        A.   Yes.  Yes.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Did you yourself ever report the accident

         12   to anyone working on the vessel?

         13        A.   Yes, I actually reported incident to my

         14   supervisor.

         15        Q.   Who was that?  Who was your supervisor?

         16        A.   The assistant beverage manager.  The assistant

         17   beverage manager, yes.  And she asked -- she were around --

         18   he was around, and yeah, I reported immediately that

         19   incident.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Did you fill out any kind of an accident

         21   form describing the accident?

         22        A.   Yes, sir, incident.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Do you remember ever, on that cruise, do

         24   you remember ever pushing the cart through that area at a

         25   time when there were lots of people there?





                                                                    20

          1        A.   Well, I remember that it is normal in the sailaway

          2   party, when we are having this -- not only one cart, but

          3   preparing five of those carts in standby, where all the

          4   beers and sodas that we need to put on ice in it.  And we

          5   have this standby cart for an ice refill that we need to use

          6   to get to the other side.  Like, I remember I have, like,

          7   four carts, four of the same carts, on standby just to fill

          8   in all of this sailaway drink, like, for beers and sodas.

          9   And yes, we needed to put some ice in there just to make

         10   that beer ice cold, ready.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Were you ever criticized or disciplined by

         12   anyone on the vessel for that accident?

         13        A.   No.

         14        Q.   Did you have any kind of conversations with

         15   anybody, other than the assistant beverage manager you

         16   mentioned, about the accident?

         17        A.   Security, the security officer.

         18        Q.   Did the security officer ask to speak with you?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   Okay.  And do you remember what that conversation

         21   was like?

         22        A.   The conversation we have -- we were in his office,

         23   and we tried to review the video, review the video.  And

         24   yes, the incident report.  I made the incident report.

         25        Q.   Okay.  So you've seen the video?





                                                                    21

          1        A.   Yes, sir.

          2        Q.   Have you seen it more than once?

          3        A.   I've seen only once during that -- when I was

          4   called to the security office.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Do you remember anything that the security

          6   officer said to you?

          7        A.   The only thing that I remember, he wants to report

          8   the incident by him.  And he said, Mark, there was a claim

          9   from the guest for the incident happened, and that's as far

         10   as I know.  That's the only thing that I remember.

         11        Q.   Okay.  I know you said you'd only seen the video

         12   once.  Do you recall thinking that what you saw on the video

         13   was what you remembered?

         14        A.   Mm-hmm.

         15        Q.   In other words, it was consistent with your memory

         16   of what happened?

         17        A.   Yes, sir.

         18        Q.   Okay.  So is this just one of those accidents that

         19   happened without anybody's fault?  Or do you believe

         20   Ms. Stephens was at least partly at fault for that accident?

         21        A.   Well, accident happened, and I believe that when

         22   that happened, it was maybe her fault.

         23        Q.   Okay.  I think the answer to my next question

         24   probably is obvious, but I think I need to ask it.  And that

         25   is, are you saying it was her fault because she wasn't





                                                                    22

          1   paying attention to the area where you were?

          2        A.   Yes, correct.

          3        Q.   Okay.

          4             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Thank you.  I think that's all I

          5   have for me.  I understand Mr. Politis may have some

          6   questions for you, and I may have some after he finishes.

          7   Okay?  But thank you.

          8             MR. POLITIS:  And do you need to take a break,

          9   Mark, at this point?  Do you want to take a five-minute

         10   bathroom break and come back?

         11             THE WITNESS:  I will get some water.

         12             MR. POLITIS:  Yeah, that would be fine.  Why don't

         13   we come back in five minutes.

         14             VIDEOGRAPHER:  Stand by.  The time is 2:19 p.m.,

         15   and we are off the record.

         16             (WHEREUPON, a recess was taken.)

         17             VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 2:30 p.m., and we are

         18   back on the record.

          1   Philippines?

          2        A.   I am, yes, sir.

          3        Q.   Okay.  How long have you been a bartender with

          4   Holland America Line, since what year?

          5        A.   Since what year?  When I was, like, elevated from

          6   where I started, as from -- we been doing this since 2003.

          7   It was like I started sanitation facility.  Then after that, I was

          8   training where I was at guest services.  And then my heart

          9   is, like, bartending.  So I start training again into other

         10   department and started GP utility and a step up from

         11   bartender to waiter and become a bartender.

         12        Q.   Okay.  So what year did you start working as a

         13   bartender on board Holland America Line ships?

         14        A.   I was a bar attendant.  Bar attendant is just like

         15   a bar waiter, in 2006.

         16        Q.   Okay.  So since 2006, you've been either a

         17   bartender or a bar attendant?

         18        A.   Yes, sir.

         19        Q.   Okay.  And in that capacity, since 2006, have you

         20   worked at the sailaway parties?

         22        Q.   What is the sailaway party?

         23        A.   Sailaway party, it is a party that we started

         24   after the embarkation.  We are beginning to start

         25   the cruise.  It could be a seven-days cruise.  It could be a





                                                                    24

          1   grand voyage cruise.  But Caribbean cruise, it's more or less,

          2   like, seven days and 10 days run, like a pretty short run

          3   for a cruise, like seven days.

          4        Q.   So it's at the beginning of the cruise?

          5        A.   It is the beginning of the cruise, correct.

          6        Q.   And in your experience, does that happen on every

          7   Holland America Line cruise?

          8        A.   Correct, yes, sir.

          9        Q.   As a bartender, did you always work those sailaway

         10   events?

         11        A.   Yes.  Yes.  Beverage and any bar stop always

         12   involved in the sailaway.  Well, side by side with the

         13   entertainment.

         14        Q.   In your experience working those sailaway events,

         15   did the bartenders use carts in the same way you were using

         16   a cart on the day of Ms. Stephens' accident?

         17        A.   Yes.  Yes, sir.

         18        Q.   Since 2006, are you aware of any passenger being

         19   injured by a cart during a sailaway event?

         20        A.   For my experience, I never heard.

         21        Q.   And you never had an incident when where you were

         22   using a cart during a sailaway.  Correct?

         23        A.   Correct.  Correct.

         24        Q.   Other than Ms. Stephens' accident?

         25        A.   Yes, sir.





                                                                    25

          1        Q.   You know, we have the video, the CCTV of the

          2   accident, which I would like to show you.

          3             MR. POLITIS:  Can the -- exhibit attendant, let's

          4   mark this as Exhibit 1.

          5             (WHEREUPON, Exhibit 1 was marked for

          6              identification.)

          7             MR. POLITIS:  Can you show that to the witness?

          8             VIDEOGRAPHER:  Yes, I can.  Would you like me to

          9   put it on a loop so that it replays?

         10             MR. POLITIS:  Well, let's just play it once, and

         11   then we'll ask the witness if he wants to see it again.

         12             VIDEOGRAPHER:  Copy that.

         13             (WHEREUPON, the videographer played the video for

         14              the witness.)

         15        Q.   (By Mr. Politis)  Would you like to see it one

         16   more time?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18             (WHEREUPON, the videographer played the video for

         19             the witness.)

         20        Q.   (By Mr. Politis)  Okay.  I think that's good.  And

         21   there's a man in a white shirt pushing the cart.  Is that

         22   you?

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   Now, watching that video, that's the same video.

         25   Is that the same video you saw in the security officer's





                                                                    26

          1   office?

          2        A.   Yes, sir.

          3        Q.   And does it fairly and accurately depict the

          4   accident as you remember it?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   At the beginning of the video, the cart is

          7   stopped.

          8        A.   Correct.

          9        Q.   It's not moving.

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   Why was that?

         12        A.   Oh, because, as I am pulling the cart, that busy

         13   area is right -- people just came from the right, so I need

         14   to move slowly and stop, and slowly forward and stop.  So as

         15   far as I remember, that was the thing that, you know --

         16        Q.   Okay.  So is it correct you had stopped the cart

         17   for passengers to cross?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   And then you had started up again just before the

         20   accident.  Correct?

         21        A.   Yes, sir.

         22        Q.   Which -- how would you describe the speed of the

         23   cart?

         24        A.   Speed.  This is like when you walk through -- just

         25   like when you walk through -- the cart, when you walk





                                                                    27

          1   through the aisle, you know, busy people from left or right.

          2   So I'm not in a hurry that time.  So I just want to

          3   transport that ice to the other side.  But I need to -- I

          4   cannot say how the speed is.  I'm stopping one step at a

          5   time, move forward one step, and move forward.  Because the

          6   aisle with people is busy.

          7             MR. POLITIS:  I don't have any more questions.

          8   Thank you.

          9             MR. WHITEHEAD:  I'd like to ask that the

         10   videographer, or whoever's in charge there, could show the

         11   video two or three times more, but let's stop between number

         12   1 and number 2, and maybe number 2 and number 3.

         13             (WHEREUPON, the reporter played the video for the

         14              witness.)

         15             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Okay.  Sorry.  Well, the next time

         16   through, please stop when the woman with the blond hair, who

         17   is standing in this picture next to Mr. Balbuena -- you need

         18   to go back and do it again.  Can you replay that, please?

         19   Stop.  Stop.  Okay.  My fault.  But the woman with the blond

         20   hair who appears to be in kind of a blue and pink top and

         21   dark shorts, that's who I want you to focus on as

         22   Ms. Stephens comes through.  So can we run it another one or

         23   two times.

         24             VIDEOGRAPHER:  I can also do a frame by frame

         25   playback if you'd like to see it slower, Mr. Whitehead.





                                                                    28

          1             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Okay.  Let's try the play by play

          2   playback, or whatever you just said.  That goes too fast.

          3             VIDEOGRAPHER:  There should be a -- playback.  I

          4   can slow it down.

          6   FURTHER EXAMINATION

          7   BY MR. WHITEHEAD:

          8        Q.   Okay.  Mr. Balbuena, did you notice what the woman

          9   with the blond hair did just before you contacted

         10   Ms. Stephens?

         11             MR. POLITIS:  I'm going to object to that.  It's

         12   vague.  I'm not sure -- well, I'll just object as vague.

         13        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  Yeah.  Well, does it appear to

         14   you that the woman with the blond hair actually was moving,

         15   perhaps to get out of Ms. Stephens' way, I don't know.  But

         16   she was moving back into the path that you, Mr. Balbuena,

         17   were traveling.  Do you agree with that?

         18             MR. POLITIS:  Objection, vague.

         19        A.   Can you please repeat your question, sir?

         20        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  Yes.  I'm going to ask the

         21   videographer to run it again in a moment.  But let me try to

         22   describe it.  Okay.  Do you see the woman with the blond

         23   hair and the kind of blue and pink top --

         24        A.   Yes.

         25        Q.   -- who's now sort of looking in the direction of





                                                                    29

          1   the man with the gray -- we're looking at his back, the gray

          2   T-shirt.  Anyway, so it's the blond woman I want you to look

          3   at, as Ms. Stephens walks in that direction.  And I'd also

          4   like you to look at where -- what do you do, Mr. Balbuena,

          5   when you see the woman with the blond hair moving in your

          6   direction.

          7             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Go ahead and play it, please.

          8             (WHEREUPON, the videographer played the video for

          9              the witness.)

         10        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  So what did you see happening

         11   there, Mr. Balbuena?

         12        A.   Yes, it just pop up on the right side, and yes,

         13   she bumped my cart.

         14        Q.   The woman with the blond hair?

         15        A.   No.  The woman with the blond hair, she's aware.

         16   She's aware that I'm coming.

         17        Q.   Who's aware that you're coming?

         18        A.   As far as the video was shown, yes, that woman,

         19   that woman is right beside me.

         20        Q.   She saw that you were coming?

         21        A.   No, no.  I did say that she saw them coming, but

         22   she just, like, staying there, staying there and not moving

         23   at all.

         24        Q.   You didn't see the woman with the blond hair

         25   moving just before the accident?





                                                                    30

          1             MR. POLITIS:  Objection, misstates testimony,

          2   vague.

          3        A.   No.  In the video, I could see her.  But as far as

          4   I'm -- I have problem with the cart, I know that there was a

          5   woman that's right in front or in the right side of my cart.

          6   And it's not moving.

          7        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  Well, I may have to ask you

          8   again.  But let's show this one more time.  And I want you

          9   to focus on you, Mr. Balbuena, and I'll try to say "stop" at

         10   the right time.

         11             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Okay.  You can run it.

         12             VIDEOGRAPHER:  Yeah, I'm going to go frame by

         13   frame here, if that helps everybody.  Does that look okay?

         14             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Yeah.

         15        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  Yeah, Mr. Balbuena -- stop --

         16   just before this point here, do you see that your head was

         17   pointed towards the bar?

         18        A.   Yeah, I could see that, yes, the right side.

         19        Q.   And why was that?  Why were you looking towards

         20   the bar?

         21        A.   I was looking people from left to right.

         22        Q.   Okay.  So when you looked toward the bar, you had

         23   not yet made contact with Ms. Stephens.  Correct?

         24        A.   I'm looking from forward, from left to right.  It

         25   is my ice that is -- I'm looking right to left and forward.





                                                                    31

          1        Q.   Well, do you recall the woman with the blond hair,

          2   did she actually bump into your cart before the accident?

          3        A.   As far as in the CCTV, yes, I could see her.  I

          4   could see her that she was just, like, almost in my cart.

          5        Q.   So is that a time that you would have wanted to

          6   stop moving the cart?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   But you didn't stop moving the cart at that point.

          9   Right?

         10        A.   I stopped.  I stopped that time.

         11        Q.   You stopped when -- what time are you talking

         12   about?  When do you think you stopped?

         13        A.   I stopped from time to time.  I'm stopping from

         14   time to time.

         15        Q.   Okay.

         16             MR. WHITEHEAD:  I guess, can we run that through

         17   one more time with the frame by frame, please.

         18             (WHEREUPON, the videographer played the video for

         19              the witness.)

         20             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Stop it there if you could.

         21        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  The woman in blond looks like

         22   she's backing into you.  Correct?

         23        A.   Backing, you mean -- yes, she is right there.  I

         24   was there at the back.

         25        Q.   And at that point, you're looking still -- are you





                                                                    32

          1   looking to your left at that point?

          2        A.   I was looking forward.  My head is a little bit

          3   left.  I could see forward, right.  That's what I am doing,

          4   as I'm moving forward with my cart.

          5             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Okay.  Let's see one more frame,

          6   please.  Well, one more, I guess.  That is nice and slow.

          7   But go ahead and let it go.

          8        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  Look at the woman with the

          9   blond hair.  Now she's backed into you.  Correct?

         10             MR. POLITIS:  Objection, vague.

         11        A.   Yes, correct.

         12        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  I mean, do you recall that she

         13   made -- the woman with the blond hair, did she make contact

         14   with that cart?

         15        A.   I don't remember, sir.  Before I -- before leading

         16   with that cart, some people just, you know, slightly -- not

         17   bumped my cart, slightly just touched the cart.  Not only

         18   this woman, but those people just, like, outside there.

         19        Q.   Is it your position -- I'm sorry.  I didn't mean

         20   to interrupt you.  Was there more to say?

         21        A.   No, what I'm saying --

         22             MR. POLITIS:  I'm going to object.  There's no

         23   question pending.  Ask him a question, please.

         24        Q.   (By Mr. Whitehead)  All right.  So do you believe

         25   that where this picture has stopped, has stopped the action,





                                                                    33

          1   do you believe that you could see Ms. Stephens at that

          2   point?

          3        A.   I didn't see her.  I didn't see her.

          4        Q.   Did not see her.

          5        A.   Yeah.

          6        Q.   And you may have tried to answer this, and I

          7   apologize if I misunderstood or didn't hear it.  But do you

          8   recall bumping into -- or the woman with the blond hair, her

          9   bumping into you?  Was there contact between that woman and

         10   your cart, to the best of your recollection?

         11        A.   Yes.  As far as I remember, not bumping, but it's

         12   just like slightly touching my cart.

         13        Q.   And wouldn't that have made you think that you

         14   should stop the cart at that point?

         15        A.   Yes, correct.

         16        Q.   And did you stop the cart?

         17        A.   I did.  I did stop the cart.

         18        Q.   From the time you stopped the cart, it didn't move

         19   forward.  Is that your testimony?

         20        A.   Yes, sir.

         21        Q.   Okay.

         22             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Okay.  I think that's all I have

         23   right now.  Thank you.

         24             MR. POLITIS:  I don't have any more questions.

         25             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Okay.  I'm going to -- I'm not





                                                                    34

          1   going to order a transcript today.  I will give that thought

          2   and let the reporter know.

          3             THE REPORTER:  Okay.  So Mr. Politis, then, would

          4   you like to order the original of today's transcript?

          5             MR. POLITIS:  Well, I think -- I think the party

          6   deposing has to order the original.

          7             THE REPORTER:  If they decline ordering the

          8   original, then I offer it to the next attorney.  And

          9   obviously, the read and sign will not be produced unless

         10   there is a transcript ordered.

         11             MR. POLITIS:  Right.  This is a first for me.  So

         12   we do want an opportunity for him to do a read/review and

         13   make any changes in the transcript.

         14             But counsel, you don't want a copy of the

         15   transcript?  You don't want it to be transcribed?

         16             MR. WHITEHEAD:  I'm saying that I'm not making a

         17   decision on that today.  You know, for example, if we

         18   mediated tomorrow, sometime soon, I'm trying to save my

         19   client some money.

         20             MR. POLITIS:  Okay.

         21             THE REPORTER:  So Mr. Politis, what I can do is

         22   make a note that if the original is ordered by attorney

         23   Whitehead, then we will produce the read and sign and send

         24   that to you.

         25             MR. POLITIS:  Okay.  Well, we're going to need --





                                                                    35

          1   I'm going to need the video, in any event.  And I think if

          2   -- I mean, bottom line, if it's not asked for by counsel for

          3   plaintiff, we will request that a transcript be generated

          4   and produced.

          5             THE REPORTER:  Okay.

          6             MR. POLITIS:  So that's -- I don't know what your

          7   time frame is on that.  Is that something where you just

          8   await the order?

          9             THE REPORTER:  Yes.  Once the order is officially

         10   received, the standard time is approximately two weeks.

         11             MR. POLITIS:  To get the transcript?

         12             THE REPORTER:  Yes, sir.

         13             MR. POLITIS:  Okay.

         14             THE REPORTER:  So I just want to be clear, then,

         15   would you like to for sure order that?  Or would you like to

         16   wait and see what Mr. Whitehead decides to do?

         17             MR. POLITIS:  If Mr. Whitehead orders it, then we

         18   will not order it.  If he decides not to order it, we will

         19   order it so we have it available.  And I want a copy of the

         20   video in any event.

         21             VIDEOGRAPHER:  Mr. Whitehead, did you want the

         22   original of the video, or did you want to wait?

         23             MR. WHITEHEAD:  I already have a copy of the

         24   video.  So I won't ask for it.

         25             MR. POLITIS:  We're talking about the video of the





                                                                    36

          1   deposition.

          2             MR. WHITEHEAD:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'll

          3   hold off on that as well.

          4             VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Well, this is the end of the

          5   deposition of Mark Balbuena.  The time is 2:50 p.m.

          6             (Whereupon, the deposition was concluded at
